3. Document Directory: Create a directory to store your project documents.
## Import Packages
Let's start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This code snippet initializes the project and adds a task with 50% progress.
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;

```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Begin by creating a new Java project in your development environment.
## Step 2: Import Necessary Packages
In your Java class, import the required packages: `Project` and `Task`.
## Step 3: Specify Document Directory
Define the path to your document directory to store project files.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 4: Create a New Project
Use the `Project` class to create a new project.
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
## Step 5: Add a Task
Utilize the `Task` class to add a new task to your project.
```java
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task");
```
## Step 6: Set Task Progress
Set the progress of the task using the `set` method and the `Tsk.PERCENT_COMPLETE` attribute.
```java
task.set(Tsk.PERCENT_COMPLETE, percent(50));
```
### Step 7: Display Progress
Retrieve and display the task progress.
```java
System.out.println(task.get(Tsk.PERCENT_COMPLETE));
```
By following these steps, you've successfully changed the progress of a task using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
