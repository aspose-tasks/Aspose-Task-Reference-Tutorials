```
## Step 3: Calculate Task Finish Date with Different Durations
Now, calculate the task's finish date for various durations:
## Step 3.1: Duration of 8 Hours
```java
System.out.println("Start Date: " + splitTask.get(Tsk.START) + "\n+ Duration 8 hours\nFinish Date: " + calendar.getTaskFinishDateFromDuration(splitTask, 8d));
```
