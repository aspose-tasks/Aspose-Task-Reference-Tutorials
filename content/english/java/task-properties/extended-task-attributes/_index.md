## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on leveraging extended task attributes in Aspose.Tasks for Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that allows you to work with Microsoft Project documents seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into the extended task attributes and demonstrate how you can utilize them to enhance your project management capabilities.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Installed Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages to kick off your Aspose.Tasks project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.CustomFieldType;
import com.aspose.tasks.ExtendedAttribute;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps to guide you through the process:
## Step 1: Accessing Task and Extended Attributes
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "ReadTaskExtendedAttributes.mpp");
for (Task tsk : project.getRootTask().getChildren()) {
    for (ExtendedAttribute ea : tsk.getExtendedAttributes()) {
```
## Step 2: Retrieving Field ID and Value GUID
```java
System.out.println(ea.getFieldId());
System.out.println(ea.getValueGuid());
```
## Step 3: Handling Different Attribute Types
```java
switch (ea.getAttributeDefinition().getCfType()) {
    case CustomFieldType.Date:
    case CustomFieldType.Start:
    case CustomFieldType.Finish:
        System.out.println(ea.getDateValue());
        break;
    case CustomFieldType.Text:
        System.out.println(ea.getTextValue());
        break;
    case CustomFieldType.Duration:
        System.out.println(ea.getDurationValue().toString());
        break;
    case CustomFieldType.Cost:
    case CustomFieldType.Number:
        System.out.println(ea.getNumericValue());
        break;
    case CustomFieldType.Flag:
        System.out.println(ea.getFlagValue());
        break;
}
```
Repeat these steps for each task in your project to explore and manipulate extended task attributes.
