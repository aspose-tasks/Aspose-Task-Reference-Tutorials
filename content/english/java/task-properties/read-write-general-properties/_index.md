## Introduction
Unlock the full potential of task management in Java with Aspose.Tasks. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into reading and writing general properties of tasks using Aspose.Tasks for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, this tutorial will equip you with the skills to manipulate task properties effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Tasks for Java library downloaded and set up. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
- A code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
## Import Packages
To kick things off, import the necessary packages in your Java project. This step ensures that you have access to the Aspose.Tasks functionalities. Here's a snippet to guide you:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.ChildTasksCollector;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.TaskUtils;
import com.aspose.tasks.Tsk;
import java.util.Calendar;
```
## Reading General Properties of Tasks
## Step 1: Create a Task
Begin by creating a task in your project. This involves setting up the task name, start date, and other relevant details. Here's an example:
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Project project = new Project();
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task1");
java.util.Calendar cal = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2013, Calendar.JULY, 17, 8, 0, 0);
task.set(Tsk.START, cal.getTime());
task.set(Tsk.NAME, "new name");
```
## Step 2: Read Task Properties
Now that you've created a task, let's retrieve and display its general properties. The following code snippet accomplishes this:
```java
// Reading General Properties of Tasks
Project prj = new Project(dataDir + "project.xml");
ChildTasksCollector collector = new ChildTasksCollector();
TaskUtils.apply(prj.getRootTask(), collector, 0);
for (Task tsk : collector.getTasks()) {
    System.out.println("Task Id:" + tsk.get(Tsk.ID));
    System.out.println("Task Uid: " + tsk.get(Tsk.UID));
    System.out.println("Task Name: " + tsk.get(Tsk.NAME));
    System.out.println("Task Start: " + tsk.get(Tsk.START));
    System.out.println("Task Finish: " + tsk.get(Tsk.FINISH));
}
```
## Writing General Properties of Tasks
## Step 3: Load Project and Create Collector
To write general properties, load an existing project and set up a `ChildTasksCollector`:
```java
Project prj = new Project(dataDir + "project.xml");
ChildTasksCollector collector = new ChildTasksCollector();
TaskUtils.apply(prj.getRootTask(), collector, 0);
```
## Step 4: Parse and Display Properties
Finally, parse through the collected tasks and display their properties:
```java
for (Task tsk : collector.getTasks()) {
    System.out.println("Task Id:" + tsk.get(Tsk.ID));
    System.out.println("Task Uid: " + tsk.get(Tsk.UID));
    System.out.println("Task Name: " + tsk.get(Tsk.NAME));
    System.out.println("Task Start: " + tsk.get(Tsk.START));
    System.out.println("Task Finish: " + tsk.get(Tsk.FINISH));
}
```
Congratulations! You've successfully read and written general properties of tasks using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
