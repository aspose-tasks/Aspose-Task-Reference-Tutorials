## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks for Java is a powerful library that facilitates handling tasks, managing projects, and manipulating project data effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a crucial aspect of project management â€“ handling estimated and milestone tasks using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.Tasks for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages to utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java functionalities.
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.ChildTasksCollector;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.TaskUtils;
import com.aspose.tasks.Tsk;

```
## Step 1: Create a ChildTasksCollector instance
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.xml");
ChildTasksCollector collector = new ChildTasksCollector();
```
## Step 2: Collect all tasks from RootTask using TaskUtils
```java
TaskUtils.apply(project.getRootTask(), collector, 0);
```
## Step 3: Parse through all the collected tasks
```java
for (Task tsk : collector.getTasks()) {
    String strED = tsk.get(Tsk.IS_EFFORT_DRIVEN) != null ? "EffortDriven" : "Non-EffortDriven";
    String strCrit = tsk.get(Tsk.IS_CRITICAL) != null ? "Critical" : "Non-Critical";
    System.out.println(strED);
    System.out.println(strCrit);
}
```
In these steps, we utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java to collect and analyze tasks, extracting information related to whether a task is effort-driven and critical or not.
By breaking down the example into these steps, we aim to make the process clear and manageable for users at various skill levels.
