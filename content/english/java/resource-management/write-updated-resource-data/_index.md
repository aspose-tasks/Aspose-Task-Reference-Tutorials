## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through updating Microsoft Project resource data using Aspose.Tasks for Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java API that allows you to manipulate Microsoft Project files without requiring Microsoft Project to be installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Tasks in your Java code. Add the following import statements to your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.Rsc;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Data Directory

Define the directory where your data files are located:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```

## Step 2: Specify Input and Output Files

Define the paths for the input MS Project file and the resulting updated file:

```java
String file = dataDir + "ResourceWithExtAttribs.xml"; // Test file with one rsc to update
String resultFile = dataDir + "OutputMPP.mpp"; // File to write test project
```

## Step 3: Load the Project

Load the MS Project file into a `Project` object:

```java
Project project = new Project(file);
```

## Step 4: Add a Resource and Set Attributes

Add a new resource to the project and set its attributes such as standard rate, overtime rate, and group:

```java
Resource rsc = project.getResources().add("Rsc");
rsc.set(Rsc.STANDARD_RATE, BigDecimal.valueOf(30));
rsc.set(Rsc.OVERTIME_RATE, BigDecimal.valueOf(45));
rsc.set(Rsc.GROUP, "Workgroup1");
```

## Step 5: Save the Project

Save the updated project with the modified resource data:

```java
project.save(resultFile, SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to update MS Project resource data using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following these steps, you can efficiently manipulate resource information in your MS Project files programmatically.
