## Introduction
Welcome to our step-by-step guide on performing percentage calculations for MS Project resources using Aspose.Tasks for Java. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of leveraging Aspose.Tasks to manipulate and extract resource data from Microsoft Project files efficiently. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java API that provides comprehensive features for working with Microsoft Project documents, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate project management functionalities into their Java applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
### Java Development Environment
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
### Aspose.Tasks Library
You need to have the Aspose.Tasks library integrated into your Java project. If you haven't done so already, you can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
Before we start coding, let's import the necessary packages required for this tutorial:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.Rsc;
```
## Step 1: Set up Project File Path
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to your Microsoft Project file.
## Step 2: Load the Project
```java
Project prj = new Project(dataDir + "Software Development.mpp");
```
This code loads the Microsoft Project file named "Software Development.mpp" located in the specified data directory.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Resources
```java
for (Resource res : prj.getResources()) {
```
We loop through each resource in the project.
## Step 4: Check Resource Name and Percentage Work Complete
```java
if (res.get(Rsc.NAME) != null) {
    System.out.println(res.get(Rsc.PERCENT_WORK_COMPLETE));
}
```
We check if the resource name is not null and then print the percentage of work completed for each resource.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java to perform percentage calculations for MS Project resources efficiently. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate project management functionalities into your Java applications, providing enhanced control and insights into project resource utilization.
