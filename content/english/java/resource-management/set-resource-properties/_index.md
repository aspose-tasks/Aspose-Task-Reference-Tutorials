## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
### Java Development Environment Setup
1. Install JDK: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

```

## Step 1: Create a Project Object
Firstly, instantiate a `Project` object to start working with MS Project data.

```java
Project project = new Project();
```
## Step 2: Add a Resource
Next, add a resource to the project using the `add()` method of the `Resources` collection.

```java
Resource rsc = project.getResources().add("Rsc");
```
## Step 3: Set Resource Properties
Now, you can set various resource properties such as standard rate and overtime rate using the appropriate constants provided by the `Rsc` class.

```java
// Set standard rate for the resource
rsc.set(Rsc.STANDARD_RATE, BigDecimal.valueOf(15));
// Set overtime rate for the resource
rsc.set(Rsc.OVERTIME_RATE, BigDecimal.valueOf(20));
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Aspose.Tasks for Java offers a convenient solution for managing MS Project resource properties in Java applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate resource management functionalities into your projects, enhancing efficiency and productivity.
