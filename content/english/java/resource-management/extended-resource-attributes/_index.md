## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to effectively handle extended Microsoft Project resource attributes using Aspose.Tasks for Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically, offering extensive functionalities for task and resource management.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Environment: Set up Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Have an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA installed for Java development.

## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. 
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.ExtendedAttribute;
import com.aspose.tasks.ExtendedAttributeDefinition;
import com.aspose.tasks.ExtendedAttributeResource;
import com.aspose.tasks.ExtendedAttributeTask;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
```
## Step 1: Define Data Directory
Set the path to the directory where your project data resides.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load Project File
Instantiate a `Project` object by loading your Microsoft Project file.
```java
Project prj = new Project(dataDir + "ResourceWithExtAttribs.xml");
```
## Step 3: Define Extended Attribute
Define the extended attribute for the resource.
```java
ExtendedAttributeDefinition myNumber1 = prj.getExtendedAttributes().getById((int) ExtendedAttributeTask.Number1);
if (myNumber1 == null) {
    myNumber1 = ExtendedAttributeDefinition.createResourceDefinition(ExtendedAttributeResource.Number1, "Age");
    prj.getExtendedAttributes().add(myNumber1);
}
```
## Step 4: Create Extended Attribute and Set Value
Create the extended attribute and assign a numeric value to it.
```java
ExtendedAttribute number1Resource = myNumber1.createExtendedAttribute();
number1Resource.setNumericValue(BigDecimal.valueOf(30.5345));
```
## Step 5: Add Resource and Extended Attribute
Add a new resource to the project along with its extended attribute.
```java
Resource rsc = prj.getResources().add("R1");
rsc.getExtendedAttributes().add(number1Resource);
```
## Step 6: Save Project
Save the modified project to a new file.
```java
prj.save(dataDir + "project5.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```
## Step 7: Display Result
Print a message confirming the completion of the process.
```java
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```
By following these steps meticulously, you can seamlessly handle extended MS Project resource attributes using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
