## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Aspose.Tasks for Java to render MS Project Resource Usage and Sheet views. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with Microsoft Project files without the need for Microsoft Project to be installed.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java Development Kit installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
First, you need to import the necessary packages to your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.PdfSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.tasks.PresentationFormat;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveOptions;
import com.aspose.tasks.Timescale;
import java.io.IOException;
```
## Step 1: Read the Source Project
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
// Read the source Project
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "ResourceUsageView.mpp");
```
In this step, we specify the path to the source Project file (`ResourceUsageView.mpp`) and use the `Project` class to read it.
## Step 2: Define SaveOptions with Required TimeScale Settings
```java
// Define the SaveOptions with required TimeScale settings as Days
SaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
options.setTimescale(Timescale.Days);
```
Here, we define the `SaveOptions` with the required `TimeScale` settings. In this example, we set the `TimeScale` to Days.
## Step 3: Set the Presentation Format to ResourceUsage
```java
// Set the Presentation format to ResourceUsage
options.setPresentationFormat(PresentationFormat.ResourceUsage);
```
We set the presentation format to `ResourceUsage`, indicating that we want to render the Resource Usage view.
## Step 4: Save the Project
```java
// Save the Project
project.save(dataDir + days, options);
```
Finally, we save the Project with the specified options. In this example, the output file will be saved as `result_days.pdf`.
## Step 5: Render Views for Other TimeScale Settings
Repeat Steps 2 to 4 for rendering views with different TimeScale settings (ThirdsOfMonths and Months).
```java
// Set the Timescale settings to ThirdsOfMonths
options.setTimescale(Timescale.ThirdsOfMonths);
// Save the Project
project.save(thirds, options);
// Set the Timescale settings to Months
options.setTimescale(Timescale.Months);
// Save the project
project.save(dataDir + months, options);
```
Ensure to change the `Timescale` settings accordingly for each view.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to use Aspose.Tasks for Java to render MS Project Resource Usage and Sheet views. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently generate these views in PDF format, facilitating better visualization and analysis of your project data.
