2. Obtain License: If you intend to use Aspose.Tasks in a production environment, acquire a license from the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Packages
To start utilizing Aspose.Tasks in your Java project, you need to import necessary packages. Here's how you can do it step by step:
## Step 1: Add Aspose.Tasks Dependency
Ensure that you have added Aspose.Tasks as a dependency in your Java project. You can do this by including the following Maven dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-tasks</artifactId>
    <version>xx.xx</version> <!-- Replace xx.xx with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```
## Step 2: Import Aspose.Tasks Classes
In your Java code, import the necessary Aspose.Tasks classes:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for better understanding and implementation:
## Step 1: Initialize Project Object
To work with a Microsoft Project file, initialize a `Project` object and provide the path to your Project file:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir);
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path to your Project file.
## Step 2: Get Number of Pages
Retrieve the number of pages in the Project file using the `getPageCount()` method:
```java
int iPages = project.getPageCount();
```
This will give you the total number of pages in the Project file.
## Step 3: Get Number of Pages with Timescale
You can also obtain the number of pages with specific timescales, such as Months or ThirdsOfMonths:
```java
// Get number of pages with Timescale.Months
iPages = project.getPageCount(0, Timescale.Months);
// Get number of pages with Timescale.ThirdsOfMonths
iPages = project.getPageCount(0, Timescale.ThirdsOfMonths);
```
These additional steps allow you to customize your page count based on specific timescales.
