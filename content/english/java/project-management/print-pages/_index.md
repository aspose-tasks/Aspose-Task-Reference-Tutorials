## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of printing pages to separate images using Aspose.Tasks for Java. This functionality can be particularly useful when you need to visualize project layouts or critical tasks separately.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.Tasks for Java library in your project. You can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
Make sure to import the necessary packages at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Gridline;
import com.aspose.tasks.GridlineType;
import com.aspose.tasks.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.tasks.LinePattern;
import com.aspose.tasks.Prj;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import java.awt.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
## Step 1: Load Project Data
First, load the project data from your MPP file:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "CustomerFeedback.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Set Image Save Options
Define the options for saving the image, including start date, end date, critical tasks, legend, and gridlines:
```java
ImageSaveOptions saveOptions = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.Png);
java.util.Calendar cal = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
cal.setTime(project.get(Prj.START_DATE));
cal.add(java.util.Calendar.DATE, -3);
saveOptions.setStartDate(cal.getTime());
saveOptions.setEndDate(project.get(Prj.FINISH_DATE));
saveOptions.setMarkCriticalTasks(true);
saveOptions.setLegendOnEachPage(false);
```
## Step 3: Customize Gridlines
Customize gridlines for the image, specifying type, color, and pattern:
```java
saveOptions.setGridlines(new ArrayList<Gridline>());
Gridline gridline = new Gridline();
gridline.setGridlineType(GridlineType.GanttRow);
gridline.setColor(Color.BLUE);
gridline.setPattern(LinePattern.Dashed);
saveOptions.getGridlines().add(gridline);
```
## Step 4: Save Images
Save the project layout as images, both as a single file and separate files:
```java
project.save(dataDir + "CustomerFeedback.png", saveOptions);
saveOptions.setRenderToSinglePage(false);
project.save(dataDir + "CustomerFeedback_.png", saveOptions);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to print pages to separate images using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently visualize project layouts and critical tasks according to your requirements.
