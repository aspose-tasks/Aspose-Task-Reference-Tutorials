## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of calculating the critical path in MS Project using Aspose.Tasks for Java. The critical path is essential for project management as it helps identify the sequence of tasks that must be completed on time to ensure the project's overall schedule is not delayed.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java library downloaded and added to your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
To start, import the necessary packages in your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Data Directory
Define the path to your data directory where your MS Project file is located.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load MS Project File
Load the MS Project file using Aspose.Tasks library.
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "New project 2013.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Set Calculation Mode
Set the calculation mode to automatic to enable the calculation of the critical path.
```java
project.setCalculationMode(CalculationMode.Automatic);
```
## Step 4: Add Tasks
Add tasks to your project. In this example, we add three subtasks.
```java
Task subtask1 = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("1");
Task subtask2 = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("2");
Task subtask3 = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("3");
```
## Step 5: Create Task Links
Create task links to define the dependencies between tasks.
```java
project.getTaskLinks().add(subtask1, subtask2, TaskLinkType.FinishToStart);
```
## Step 6: Display Critical Path
Retrieve and display the critical path of the project.
```java
for (Task task : project.getCriticalPath()) {
    System.out.println(task.get(Tsk.NAME));
}
```
## Step 7: Display Result
Display a message indicating the successful completion of the process.
```java
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```

## Conclusion
Calculating the critical path in MS Project using Aspose.Tasks for Java is crucial for effective project management. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can accurately identify the sequence of tasks critical to your project's timeline.
