## Introduction
In the realm of project management, handling and updating project files is a crucial task. Aspose.Tasks for Java provides a powerful solution for Java developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into updating MPP files using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for Java from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming language is necessary to follow along with the examples.

## Import Packages
Firstly, you need to import the necessary packages to your Java project to utilize Aspose.Tasks functionalities effectively.

```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.Tsk;
import java.util.Calendar;
```
This line of code imports all the essential classes and methods from the Aspose.Tasks library, allowing you to work with Microsoft Project files effortlessly.

Now, let's break down the process of updating an MPP file using Aspose.Tasks for Java into manageable steps.
## Step 2: Define Data Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path where your MPP file is located.
## Step 3: Read Existing Project
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "SampleMSP2010.mpp");
```
This code reads an existing MPP project file named `SampleMSP2010.mpp` from the specified data directory.
## Step 4: Create a New Task
```java
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task1");
```
Here, we add a new task named "Task1" to the root task of the project.
## Step 5: Set Start and Finish Dates
```java
java.util.Calendar cal = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2012, Calendar.JULY, 1, 8, 0, 0);
task.set(Tsk.START, cal.getTime());
cal.set(2012, Calendar.JULY, 1, 17, 0, 0);
task.set(Tsk.FINISH, cal.getTime());
```
These lines of code set the start date and finish date for the newly created task.
## Step 6: Save the Project
```java
project.save(dataDir + "AfterLinking.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
Finally, this step saves the updated project with the newly added task to a new MPP file named `AfterLinking.mpp`.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to update MPP files using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following the step-by-step guide, you can efficiently manipulate Microsoft Project files within your Java applications.
