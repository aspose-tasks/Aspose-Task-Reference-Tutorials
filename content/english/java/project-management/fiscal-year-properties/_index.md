## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that enables developers to efficiently manage project files, including handling fiscal year properties. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of managing fiscal year properties using Aspose.Tasks in Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java JAR: Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and include it in your project.

## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages in your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Load Project File
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
In this step, we load the project file named "project.mpp" located in the specified data directory.
## Step 2: Display Fiscal Year Properties
```java
//Display fiscal year properties
System.out.println("Fiscal Year Start Date : " + project.get(Prj.FY_START_DATE));
System.out.println("Fiscal Year Numbering : " + project.get(Prj.FISCAL_YEAR_START));
```
This step retrieves and prints the start date and numbering of the fiscal year from the loaded project.
## Step 3: Setting Project Fiscal Year Properties
```java
//Create a project instance
Project prj = new Project();
//Set fiscal year properties
prj.set(Prj.FY_START_DATE, Month.JULY);
prj.set(Prj.FISCAL_YEAR_START, new NullableBool(true));
//Save the project as XML project file
prj.save(dataDir + "savedProject.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```
Here, we create a new project instance, set the fiscal year start date to July and enable fiscal year numbering. Then, we save the modified project as an XML file.
## Step 4: Display Result
```java
//Display result of conversion.
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```
Finally, we print a message indicating successful completion of the process.

## Conclusion
Managing fiscal year properties in Aspose.Tasks for Java is straightforward with the provided API. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently handle fiscal year-related tasks in your projects.
