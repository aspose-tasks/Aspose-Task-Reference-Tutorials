## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into utilizing Aspose.Tasks for Java, a powerful library for manipulating Microsoft Project files programmatically. We'll focus on a fundamental task: writing MS Project information using Aspose.Tasks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey in Java programming, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for Java library. You can obtain it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE of your preference. We recommend IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Import Packages
First, import the necessary packages in your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
import java.util.Calendar;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Data Directory
Define the directory where your project data will be stored.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create Project Instance
Initialize a new project instance.
```java
Project project = new Project();
```
## Step 3: Set Project Information Properties
Set properties for the project such as start date, schedule from start, and status date.
```java
project.set(Prj.SCHEDULE_FROM_START, new NullableBool(true));
java.util.Calendar cal = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2014, Calendar.JULY, 10);
project.set(Prj.START_DATE, cal.getTime());
project.set(Prj.CURRENT_DATE, cal.getTime());
project.set(Prj.STATUS_DATE, cal.getTime());
```
## Step 4: Save Project as XML
Save the project with the updated information as an XML file.
```java
project.save(dataDir + "project3.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to write MS Project information using Aspose.Tasks for Java. With this newfound knowledge, you can automate various tasks related to Microsoft Project files, enhancing your productivity as a Java developer.
