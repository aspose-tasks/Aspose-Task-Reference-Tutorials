import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
```

## Step 1: Define Data Directory
Set the path to your data directory where your MS Project file is located.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path to your data directory.
## Step 2: Load MS Project File
Load the MS Project file into a `Project` object using Aspose.Tasks.
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
Replace `"project.mpp"` with the name of your MS Project file.
## Step 3: Retrieve Currency Symbol
Extract the currency symbol from the loaded project file.
```java
System.out.println(project.get(Prj.CURRENCY_SYMBOL));
```
This code retrieves the currency symbol and prints it to the console.
