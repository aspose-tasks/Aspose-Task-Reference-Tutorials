## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to manage MS Project calendar properties using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By understanding how to manipulate calendar properties, you can tailor project schedules to meet specific requirements efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
### Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation
Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
### Aspose.Tasks for Java Library
Download and set up the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```

## Step 1: Set up the Data Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to your data directory.
## Step 2: Define Time Units
```java
long OneSec = 1000; // 1000 milliseconds
long OneMin = 60 * OneSec;
long OneHour = 60 * OneMin;
```
Here, we define time units for convenience.
## Step 3: Load Project Data
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.xml");
```
Load the MS Project data from the specified XML file.
## Step 4: Iterate Through Calendars
```java
for (Calendar cal : project.getCalendars()) {
    if (cal.getName() == null) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println("UID: " + cal.getUid() + " Name: " + cal.getName());
    // Show if it has a base calendar
    System.out.print("Base Calendar: ");
    System.out.println(cal.isBaseCalendar() ? "Self" : cal.getBaseCalendar().getName());
    // Iterate through weekdays
    for (WeekDay wd : cal.getWeekDays()) {
        double ts = wd.getWorkingTime();
        System.out.println("Day Type: " + DayType.toString(DayType.class, wd.getDayType()) + " Hours: " + ts / OneHour);
    }
}
```
This loop iterates through each calendar in the project, displaying its properties such as UID, name, base calendar, and working hours for each day type.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you've learned how to manage MS Project calendar properties using Aspose.Tasks for Java. This knowledge empowers you to customize project schedules effectively, ensuring alignment with project requirements.
