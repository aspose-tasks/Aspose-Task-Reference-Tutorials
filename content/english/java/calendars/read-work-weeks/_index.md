## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Aspose.Tasks for Java to read work weeks information from a Microsoft Project calendar. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that allows you to manipulate and manage Microsoft Project documents programmatically.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java library downloaded and installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
## Import Packages
First, let's import the necessary packages to get started with our code:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Calendar;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.WeekDay;
import com.aspose.tasks.WeekDayCollection;
import com.aspose.tasks.WorkWeek;
import com.aspose.tasks.WorkWeekCollection;
import com.aspose.tasks.WorkingTimeCollection;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Data Directory
Set up the directory path where your MS Project file is located:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create Project Instance and Access Calendar
Create a new instance of the Project class and access the calendar and work weeks collection:
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "ReadWorkWeeksInformation.mpp");
Calendar calendar = project.getCalendars().getByUid(3);
WorkWeekCollection collection = calendar.getWorkWeeks();
```
## Step 3: Iterate Through Work Weeks
Iterate through the collection of work weeks and display their information:
```java
for (WorkWeek workWeek : collection) {
    // Display work week name, from and to dates
    System.out.println(workWeek.getName());
    System.out.println(workWeek.getFromDate());
    System.out.println(workWeek.getToDate());
    // Access week days and working times
    WeekDayCollection weekDays = workWeek.getWeekDays();
    for (WeekDay day : weekDays) {
        WorkingTimeCollection workingTimes = day.getWorkingTimes();
        // Further process working times if needed
    }
}
```
