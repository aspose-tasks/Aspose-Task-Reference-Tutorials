## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure the Gantt MS Project Chart View in Aspose.Tasks projects using Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java API that allows you to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically. By following these steps, you'll be able to customize the Gantt chart view according to your project's requirements.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE of your choice. This tutorial uses IntelliJ IDEA, but you can use any IDE you're comfortable with.
## Import Packages
First, you need to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Tasks in your Java project. Add the following import statements to your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```
Now, let's break down the process of configuring the Gantt MS Project Chart View into step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Set Up Data Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to your project data directory.
## Step 2: Load Project File
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
Load your project file (`project.mpp` in this example) using the `Project` class from Aspose.Tasks.
## Step 3: Add New Activity
```java
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("New Activity");
```
Create a new task in your project using the `Task` class and add it to the root task's children.
## Step 4: Define Custom Attribute
```java
ExtendedAttributeDefinition text1Definition = ExtendedAttributeDefinition.createTaskDefinition(ExtendedAttributeTask.Text1, null);
project.getExtendedAttributes().add(text1Definition);
```
Define a new custom attribute using the `ExtendedAttributeDefinition` class and add it to the project's extended attributes.
## Step 5: Add Custom Attribute to Task
```java
task.getExtendedAttributes().add(text1Definition.createExtendedAttribute("Activity attribute"));
```
Add the custom attribute to the created task using the `createExtendedAttribute` method.
## Step 6: Customize Table
```java
TableField attrField = new TableField();
attrField.setField(Field.TaskText1);
attrField.setWidth(20);
attrField.setTitle("Custom attribute");
attrField.setAlignTitle(HorizontalStringAlignment.Center);
attrField.setAlignData(HorizontalStringAlignment.Center);
Table table = project.getTables().toList().get(0);
table.getTableFields().add(3, attrField);
```
Customize the table by adding the text attribute field with specified width, title, and alignment.
## Step 7: Save Project
```java
project.save("saved.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
Save the project with the configured Gantt MS Project Chart View. The resulting file can be opened in Microsoft Project 2010.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully configured the Gantt MS Project Chart View in Aspose.Tasks projects using Java. You can now customize project attributes and visualize them in the Gantt chart according to your project's needs.
