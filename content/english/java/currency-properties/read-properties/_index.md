## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java to read currency properties from Microsoft Project files. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java API that enables developers to manipulate Microsoft Project documents without requiring Microsoft Project to be installed. By following the steps outlined below, you'll be able to extract currency-related information effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java JAR: Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and include it in your Java project.
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
First, set up your project directory where your Microsoft Project file is located. You can define this directory path as follows:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path to your project directory.
## Step 2: Create a Project Reader Instance
Instantiate a `Project` object by providing the path to your Microsoft Project file:
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
Ensure to replace `"project.mpp"` with the name of your MS Project file.
## Step 3: Display Currency Properties
Retrieve and display currency properties from the project file:
```java
System.out.println("Currency Code : " + project.get(Prj.CURRENCY_CODE).toString());
System.out.println("<br>Currency Digits : " + project.get(Prj.CURRENCY_DIGITS).toString());
System.out.println("<br>Currency Symbol : " + project.get(Prj.CURRENCY_SYMBOL).toString());
System.out.println("Currency Symbol Position" + project.get(Prj.CURRENCY_SYMBOL_POSITION).toString());
```
This code segment fetches information such as currency code, digits, symbol, and symbol position from the MS Project file and prints them to the console.
## Step 4: Process Completion
Lastly, print a message indicating successful completion of the process:
```java
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to read currency properties from Microsoft Project files using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following the outlined steps, you can effortlessly extract currency-related information from your project files programmatically, enabling seamless integration into your Java applications.
