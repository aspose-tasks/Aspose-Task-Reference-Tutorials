## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into managing resource assignments rate scale using Aspose.Tasks for Java, a robust library for working with Microsoft Project files programmatically. By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively manipulate rate scale settings for resource assignments in your Java applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
First, you need to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Tasks functionalities. 
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Asn;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.RateScaleType;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.ResourceAssignment;
import com.aspose.tasks.ResourceType;
import com.aspose.tasks.Rsc;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import java.io.IOException;
```
## Step 1: Set up your project
Start by setting up your Java project and include the Aspose.Tasks library in your dependencies.
## Step 2: Load the Project File
Load the Project file you want to work with into your Java application.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "New project 2013.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Add a Task
Add a new task to your project.
```java
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("t1");
```
## Step 4: Define Resources
Define material and non-material resources and specify their types.
```java
Resource materialResource = project.getResources().add("materialResource");
materialResource.set(Rsc.TYPE, ResourceType.Material);
Resource nonMaterialResource = project.getResources().add("nonMaterialResource");
nonMaterialResource.set(Rsc.TYPE, ResourceType.Work);
```
## Step 5: Assign Resources to Task
Assign the previously defined resources to the task along with their rate scale types.
```java
ResourceAssignment materialResourceAssignment = project.getResourceAssignments().add(task, materialResource);
materialResourceAssignment.set(Asn.RATE_SCALE, RateScaleType.Week);
ResourceAssignment nonMaterialResourceAssignment = project.getResourceAssignments().add(task, nonMaterialResource);
nonMaterialResourceAssignment.set(Asn.RATE_SCALE, RateScaleType.Week);
```
## Step 6: Save the Project
Save the project with the modified resource assignments.
```java
project.save("output.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
## Step 7: Retrieve Resource Assignments
Reload the saved project and retrieve resource assignments to verify the rate scale settings.
```java
Project resavedProject = new Project("output.mpp");
ResourceAssignment resavedMaterialResourceAssignment = resavedProject.getResourceAssignments().getByUid(1);
System.out.println(resavedMaterialResourceAssignment.get(Asn.RATE_SCALE));
ResourceAssignment resavedNonMaterialResourceAssignment = resavedProject.getResourceAssignments().getByUid(2);
```

## Conclusion
Managing resource assignments rate scale in Aspose.Tasks for Java is crucial for effective project management. By following this step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly manipulate rate scale settings for resource assignments in your Java applications.
