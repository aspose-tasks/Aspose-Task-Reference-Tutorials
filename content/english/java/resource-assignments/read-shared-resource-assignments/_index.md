## Introduction
In project management, efficient resource allocation is crucial for successful project completion. Aspose.Tasks for Java provides powerful tools to manage resources effectively. One essential task is reading shared resource assignments, which allows you to understand how resources are allocated across multiple projects.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Tasks for Java library downloaded and added to your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
To start, import the necessary packages in your Java code:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.Rsc;
```

Let's break down the example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define Data Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Define the directory where your project data resides.
## Step 2: Load Project File
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "ResourceCosts.mpp");
```
Load the project file containing shared resource assignments.
## Step 3: Access Resource
```java
Resource resource = project.getResources().getByUid(1);
```
Retrieve the resource from the project by its unique identifier (UID).
## Step 4: Retrieve Resource Units
```java
Double units = resource.get(Rsc.PEAK_UNITS);
```
Retrieve the peak units of the resource, which are calculated using assignments from other projects.

## Conclusion
Reading shared resource assignments in Aspose.Tasks for Java is a fundamental operation for efficient project management. With the provided tutorial, you can easily access and analyze resource allocation across multiple projects.
