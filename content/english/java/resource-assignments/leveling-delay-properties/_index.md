## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of handling leveling delay properties for resource assignments in Aspose.Tasks for Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that allows you to work with Microsoft Project files without requiring Microsoft Project to be installed on your system.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
First, import the necessary packages into your Java project to use Aspose.Tasks functionalities:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Asn;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Resource;
import com.aspose.tasks.ResourceAssignment;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.TimeUnitType;
import com.aspose.tasks.Tsk;
import java.util.Calendar;
```

## Step 1: Create a Project Object
Instantiate a `Project` object:
```java
Project prj = new Project();
```
## Step 2: Create a Task
Add a task to the project:
```java
Task task = prj.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task 1");
```
## Step 3: Set Task Start Date and Duration
Set the start date and duration for the task:
```java
java.util.Calendar cal = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2000, Calendar.JANUARY, 3, 8, 0, 0);
task.set(Tsk.START, cal.getTime());
task.set(Tsk.DURATION, prj.getDuration(8));
```
## Step 4: Add a Resource
Add a resource to the project:
```java
Resource resource = prj.getResources().add("Resource 1");
```
## Step 5: Create a Resource Assignment
Create a resource assignment for the task and resource:
```java
ResourceAssignment assignment = prj.getResourceAssignments().add(task, resource);
```
## Step 6: Set Leveling Delay
Set the leveling delay for the assignment:
```java
assignment.set(Asn.DELAY, prj.getDuration(0, TimeUnitType.Day));
```
## Step 7: Display Results
Print the leveling delay and other relevant information:
```java
System.out.println("Delay: " + assignment.get(Asn.DELAY));
System.out.println("Leveling Delay: " + assignment.get(Asn.LEVELING_DELAY));
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to handle leveling delay properties for resource assignments in Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following these steps, you can efficiently manage resource assignments in your Java projects.
