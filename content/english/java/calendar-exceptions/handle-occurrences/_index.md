## Introduction
In the realm of project management, dealing with exceptions in calendars is crucial for maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Aspose.Tasks for Java provides a powerful toolkit for managing project-related tasks, including handling occurrences within calendars effectively. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to manage exceptions in calendar occurrences using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
### Java Development Environment Setup
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website.
2. Set Up IDE: Choose and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Aspose.Tasks for Java: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).

## Import Packages
Firstly, import the necessary packages to access the Aspose.Tasks functionalities.

```java

```
This import statement allows access to classes and methods provided by Aspose.Tasks library.

Let's break down the process of handling occurrences in calendar exceptions into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Create a Calendar Exception Object
```java
CalendarException except = new CalendarException();
```
Here, we create a new instance of the `CalendarException` class provided by Aspose.Tasks.
## Step 2: Set Entered By Occurrences
```java
except.setEnteredByOccurrences(true);
```
This step marks the exception as entered by occurrences, indicating that it's defined based on recurring events.
## Step 3: Set Occurrences
```java
except.setOccurrences(5);
```
Specify the number of occurrences for the exception. In this example, we set it to 5.
## Step 4: Set Exception Type
```java
except.setType(CalendarExceptionType.YearlyByDay);
```
Define the type of exception. Here, we set it as yearly by day, meaning it occurs annually on a particular day.
