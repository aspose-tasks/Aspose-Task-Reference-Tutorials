## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of saving data from a Project file to an Excel file step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and include it in your Java project.

## Import Packages
First, you need to import the necessary packages in your Java code to work with Aspose.Tasks.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define the Data Directory Path
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to your data directory where the Project file is located.
## Step 2: Load the Project File
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project5.mpp");
```
This line of code loads the Project file named "project5.mpp" from the specified data directory.
## Step 3: Save the Project as XLSX
```java
project.save(dataDir + "project1.xlsx", SaveFileFormat.Xlsx);
```
Here, the `save` method is used to save the loaded Project file as an Excel file with the name "project1.xlsx" in the same data directory. We specify the `SaveFileFormat.Xlsx` parameter to save it in XLSX format.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to save data from a Microsoft Project file to an Excel file using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following the provided steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
