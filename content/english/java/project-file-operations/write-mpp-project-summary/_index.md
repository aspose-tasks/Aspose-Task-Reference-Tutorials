## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java to write MPP project summaries. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library for working with Microsoft Project files. By following the steps outlined below, you will be able to set and retrieve various summary information about a project using this library.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE for Java development, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Import Packages
Firstly, import the necessary packages into your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Prj;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import java.util.Calendar;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Project and Define Summary Information
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
// Initialize a new Project object with the path to your project file
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
// Set summary information about the project
project.set(Prj.AUTHOR, "Author");
project.set(Prj.LAST_AUTHOR, "Last Author");
project.set(Prj.REVISION, 15);
project.set(Prj.KEYWORDS, "MSP Aspose");
project.set(Prj.COMMENTS, "Comments");
// Set creation date of the project
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2014, Calendar.FEBRUARY, 15, 0, 0, 0);
project.set(Prj.CREATION_DATE, cal.getTime());
// Set keywords for the project
project.set(Prj.KEYWORDS, "MPP Aspose");
// Set last printed date of the project
cal.set(2014, Calendar.MARCH, 16, 0, 0, 0);
project.set(Prj.LAST_PRINTED, cal.getTime());
```
## Step 2: Save Project Summary Information
```java
// Save the Project back in MPP format
project.save(dataDir + "MppAspose.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
// Display a success message
System.out.println("Process completed Successfully");
```
## Step 3: Read Project Summary Information
```java
// Reading Project Summary Information
project = new Project(dataDir + "MppAspose.xml");
// Print author of the project
System.out.println("Author: " + project.get(Prj.AUTHOR));
// Print last author of the project
System.out.println("Last Author: " + project.get(Prj.LAST_AUTHOR));
// Print revision number of the project
System.out.println("Revision: " + project.get(Prj.REVISION));
// Print keywords of the project
System.out.println("Keywords: " + project.get(Prj.KEYWORDS));
// Print comments of the project
System.out.println("Comments: " + project.get(Prj.COMMENTS));
// Print creation date of the project
System.out.println("Creation Date: " + project.get(Prj.CREATION_DATE).toString());
// Print keywords of the project (again)
System.out.println("Keywords: " + project.get(Prj.KEYWORDS));
// Print last printed date of the project
System.out.println("Last Printed: " + project.get(Prj.LAST_PRINTED).toString());
```
