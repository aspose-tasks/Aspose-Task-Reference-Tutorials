## Introduction
Managing time scale count in MS Project can significantly affect project visualization and management. With Aspose.Tasks for Java, a powerful API for handling project management tasks programmatically, you can efficiently manipulate time scale count to tailor project views to your specific needs.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following in place:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for Java library. You can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Basic Knowledge of Java Programming: Familiarity with Java programming language will be beneficial.

## Import Packages
Import the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.GanttChartView;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.SaveFileFormat;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.TimeUnitType;
import com.aspose.tasks.Tsk;
```

## Step 1: Set Data Directory
Define the path to the data directory where your project files will be stored:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to your data directory.
## Step 2: Create Project Instance
Instantiate a new `Project` object:
```java
Project project = new Project();
```
This creates a new project object.
## Step 3: Configure Gantt Chart View
Create a `GanttChartView` object to configure the Gantt chart view:
```java
GanttChartView view = new GanttChartView();
```
## Step 4: Set Time Scale Count for Bottom Tier
Set the count and ticks visibility for the bottom timescale tier:
```java
view.getBottomTimescaleTier().setCount(2);
view.getBottomTimescaleTier().setShowTicks(false);
```
This specifies the count of intervals and whether to display ticks for the bottom tier.
## Step 5: Set Time Scale Count for Middle Tier
Similarly, configure the middle timescale tier:
```java
view.getMiddleTimescaleTier().setCount(2);
view.getMiddleTimescaleTier().setShowTicks(false);
```
## Step 6: Add View to Project
Add the configured view to the project:
```java
project.getViews().add(view);
```
This adds the customized view to the project.
## Step 7: Add Test Data to Project
Add some test data to the project for demonstration:
```java
Task task1 = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task 1");
Task task2 = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task 2");
task1.set(Tsk.DURATION, task1.getParentProject().getDuration(24, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task2.set(Tsk.DURATION, task1.getParentProject().getDuration(40, TimeUnitType.Hour));
```
This creates two tasks with specified durations.
## Step 8: Save Project as PDF
Save the project as a PDF file:
```java
project.save(dataDir + "temp.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
This saves the project with the applied configurations to a PDF file.

## Conclusion
Effectively managing time scale count in MS Project using Aspose.Tasks for Java empowers you to customize project views for better visualization and management.
