## Introduction
In project management, customizing views can significantly enhance the clarity and efficiency of managing tasks and resources. Aspose.Tasks for Java provides powerful tools to create custom views tailored to specific project requirements. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create custom MS Project views using Aspose.Tasks for Java, step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
### Java Development Environment
Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
### Aspose.Tasks for Java
Download and install Aspose.Tasks for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
## Import Packages
First, import the necessary packages to your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Field;
import com.aspose.tasks.GanttChartView;
import com.aspose.tasks.HorizontalStringAlignment;
import com.aspose.tasks.MPPSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.tasks.Prj;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.TableField;
import com.aspose.tasks.View;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Set Up Project
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
// Create an empty project without views
Project project = new Project();
project.set(Prj.NAME, "Test View Project");
```
## Step 2: Create View
```java
// Create a standard Gantt chart view
View view = new GanttChartView();
```
## Step 3: Customize View Properties
```java
// Set some view properties
view.setShowInMenu(true); // Indicate whether to show the view in the menu
view.setHighlightFilter(true); // Indicate whether to highlight the filter for the view
```
## Step 4: Tune View Settings
```java
// Tune some view settings
view.getPageInfo().getPageViewSettings().setFirstColumnsCount(4); // Set the number of first columns to print on all pages
view.getPageInfo().getPageViewSettings().setPrintFirstColumnsCountOnAllPages(true); // Indicate whether to print specified number of first columns on all pages
```
## Step 5: Add View to Project
```java
// Add the view to our project
project.getViews().add(view);
```
## Step 6: Save Project
```java
// Save the project with the created view
MPPSaveOptions options = new MPPSaveOptions();
options.setWriteViewData(true); // Use WriteViewData flag to persist modifications of project.Views
project.save(dataDir + "workWithView_output.mpp", options);
```
## Step 7: Check View Properties
```java
// Check properties of the newly added view
System.out.println("View Uid: " + view.getUid()); // Print the unique identifier of the view
System.out.println("View Screen: " + view.getScreen()); // Print the screen type for the view
System.out.println("View Type: " + view.getType()); // Print the type of the view
System.out.println("Parent Project of the view: " + view.getParentProject().get(Prj.NAME)); // Print the parent project of the view
```
