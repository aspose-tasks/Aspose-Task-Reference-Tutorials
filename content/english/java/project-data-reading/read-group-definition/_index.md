## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files with ease. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of reading group definition data from a project file step by step using Aspose.Tasks for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Import Packages
First, let's import the necessary packages to begin working with Aspose.Tasks for Java.
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.*;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Data Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the path to the directory containing your project file.
## Step 2: Load the Project File
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "project.mpp");
```
Load your project file using the `Project` class constructor, passing the path to your project file.
## Step 3: Retrieve Task Groups Count
```java
System.out.println("Task Groups Count: " + project.getTaskGroups().size());
```
Retrieve the count of task groups in the project using the `getTaskGroups()` method.
## Step 4: Retrieve Task Group Information
```java
Group taskGroup = project.getTaskGroups().toList().get(1);
System.out.println("Percent Complete:" + taskGroup.getName());
System.out.println("Group Criteria count: " + taskGroup.getGroupCriteria().size());
```
Retrieve information about a specific task group, such as its name and the count of group criteria.
## Step 5: Retrieve Group Criterion Information
```java
GroupCriterion criterion = taskGroup.getGroupCriteria().toList().get(0);
System.out.println("Criterion Field: " + criterion.getField());
System.out.println("Criterion GroupOn: " + criterion.getGroupOn());
System.out.println("Criterion Cell Color: " + criterion.getCellColor());
System.out.println("Criterion Pattern: " + criterion.getPattern());
```
Retrieve information about the group criteria, such as the field, group on, cell color, and pattern.
## Step 6: Check Parent Group
```java
if (taskGroup == criterion.getParentGroup())
    System.out.println("Parent Group is equval to task Group.");
```
Check if the parent group is equal to the task group.
## Step 7: Retrieve Criterion's Font Information
```java
System.out.println("Font Family Name: " + criterion.getFont().getFontFamily());
System.out.println("Font Size: " + criterion.getFont().getSize());
System.out.println("Font Style: " + criterion.getFont().getStyle());
System.out.println("Ascending/Descending: " + criterion.getAscending());
```
Retrieve font information for the criterion, such as font family, size, style, and sorting order.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to read group definition data from a Microsoft Project file using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following these steps, you can effectively extract and utilize task group information in your Java applications.
