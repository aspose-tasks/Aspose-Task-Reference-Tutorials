## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to read table data from a file using Aspose.Tasks for Java. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with Microsoft Project documents programmatically.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the Oracle website.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java JAR File: Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and include it in your Java project.

## Import Packages
Import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Tasks in your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Table;
import com.aspose.tasks.TableField;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Data Directory
Define the path to the directory where your Project file is located:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path to your data directory.
## Step 2: Load the Project File
Load the Project file using Aspose.Tasks:
```java
Project project = new Project(dataDir + "Project2003.mpp");
```
Make sure to replace `"Project2003.mpp"` with the name of your Project file.
## Step 3: Retrieve Table Information
Get the table from the project and iterate through its fields:
```java
Table t1 = project.getTables().toList().get(0);
System.out.println("Table Fields Count: " + t1.getTableFields().size());
System.out.println();
for (TableField f : t1.getTableFields()) {
    System.out.println("Field width: " + f.getWidth());
    System.out.println("Field Title: " + f.getTitle());
    System.out.println("Field Title Alignment: " + f.getAlignTitle());
    System.out.println("Field Align Data: " + f.getAlignData());
    System.out.println();
}
```
This code snippet retrieves information about the table fields such as width, title, and alignment.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to read table data from a file using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following these steps, you can efficiently extract and manipulate data from Microsoft Project documents in your Java applications.
