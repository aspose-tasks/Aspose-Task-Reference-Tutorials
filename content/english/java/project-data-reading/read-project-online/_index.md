## Introduction
In the realm of project management, handling Microsoft Project Online data efficiently is crucial for streamlined operations. Aspose.Tasks for Java provides a robust solution for reading such data effortlessly. This tutorial delves into leveraging Aspose.Tasks to access and manipulate MS Project Online data seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK to compile and run Java programs.
2. Aspose.Tasks for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.Tasks library in your Java project. You can acquire it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/).
3. Microsoft Project Online Account: Obtain valid credentials for accessing MS Project Online data.
4. SharePoint Domain Address: The SharePoint domain address where your MS Project Online data resides.
5. Username and Password: Credentials for authenticating access to MS Project Online.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.Tasks packages for seamless integration:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.ProjectInfo;
import com.aspose.tasks.ProjectServerCredentials;
import com.aspose.tasks.ProjectServerManager;
```

## Step 1: Set SharePoint Domain Address, Username, and Password
```java
String sharepointDomainAddress = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com";
String userName = "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com";
String password = "MyPassword";
```
Replace `"https://contoso.sharepoint.com"` with your SharePoint domain address, `"admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"` with your username, and `"MyPassword"` with your password.
## Step 2: Authenticate with Project Server Credentials
```java
ProjectServerCredentials credentials = new ProjectServerCredentials(sharepointDomainAddress, userName, password);
ProjectServerManager reader = new ProjectServerManager(credentials);
```
Create `ProjectServerCredentials` object with the SharePoint domain address, username, and password. Then initialize `ProjectServerManager` with these credentials.
## Step 3: Retrieve Project List and Display Information
```java
for (ProjectInfo p : reader.getProjectList()) {
    System.out.println("Project Name:" + p.getName());
    System.out.println("Project Created Date:" + p.getCreatedDate());
    System.out.println("Project Last Saved Date:" + p.getLastSavedDate());
}
```
Iterate through the project list obtained from `reader.getProjectList()` and display project details such as name, creation date, and last saved date.
## Step 4: Load Individual Projects and Output Resource Count
```java
for (ProjectInfo p : reader.getProjectList()) {
    Project project = reader.getProject(p.getId());
    System.out.println("Project " + p.getName() + " loaded.");
    System.out.println("Resources count:" + project.getResources().size());
}
```
For each project, load it using `reader.getProject(p.getId())` and output the project name along with the count of associated resources.

## Conclusion
Aspose.Tasks for Java simplifies the process of reading MS Project Online data, offering developers a powerful toolset to streamline project management tasks. By following this tutorial, you can efficiently integrate Aspose.Tasks into your Java applications to access and manipulate project data with ease.
