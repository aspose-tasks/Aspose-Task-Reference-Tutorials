## Introduction
Managing task baselines is a crucial aspect of project management, enabling you to compare planned versus actual progress accurately. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to perform baseline task scheduling using Aspose.Tasks for Java. By following these steps, you'll be equipped to streamline your project management processes efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### Java Development Environment
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from the [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
### Aspose.Tasks for Java Library
Download the Aspose.Tasks for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/java/) and include it in your Java project.
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.tasks.BaselineType;
import com.aspose.tasks.Project;
import com.aspose.tasks.Task;
import com.aspose.tasks.TaskBaseline;
```
Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Create a New Project Instance
```java
Project project = new Project();
```
## Step 2: Define a Task and Set Baseline
```java
Task task = project.getRootTask().getChildren().add("Task");
project.setBaseline(BaselineType.Baseline);
```
## Step 3: Access Baseline Information
```java
TaskBaseline baseline = task.getBaselines().get(0);
```
## Step 4: Display Baseline Duration
```java
System.out.println(baseline.getDuration().toString());
```
## Step 5: Display Baseline Start Date
```java
System.out.println("Baseline Start: " + baseline.getStart());
```
## Step 6: Display Baseline Finish Date
```java
System.out.println("Baseline Finish: " + baseline.getFinish());
```
By following these steps, you can effectively utilize Aspose.Tasks for Java to manage task baselines within your projects.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, mastering baseline task scheduling is essential for accurate project management. With Aspose.Tasks for Java, you can effortlessly handle task baselines and ensure alignment between planned and actual progress, leading to successful project outcomes.
