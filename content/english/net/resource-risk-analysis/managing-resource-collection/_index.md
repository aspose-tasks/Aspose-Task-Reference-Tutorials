## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to effectively manage Microsoft Project resource collections using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful API that enables developers to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically, allowing for seamless integration and manipulation of project data.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Knowledge of C# and .NET Framework: This tutorial assumes familiarity with C# programming language and the .NET Framework.
2. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Development Environment Setup: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin, import the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.Tasks functionalities:
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


```

## Step 1: Load the Project File
Firstly, load the Microsoft Project file into the Aspose.Tasks project object:
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "SampleProject.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Add Empty Resource
Next, let's add an empty resource to the project:
```csharp
var resource = project.Resources.Add();
resource.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);
```
## Step 3: Add Resource with a Name
Now, add a resource with a specified name to the project:
```csharp
var developer = project.Resources.Add("Developer");
developer.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);
```
## Step 4: Add Resource Before Another Resource
Add a resource with a specified name before another resource based on its ID:
```csharp
var manager = project.Resources.Add("Manager", developer.Get(Rsc.Id));
manager.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);
```
## Step 5: Accessing Resources by ID or UID
You can access resources either by their ID or UID:
```csharp
var devResource = project.Resources.GetById(4);
devResource.Set(Rsc.Code, "12345");
var manResource = project.Resources.GetByUid(4);
manResource.Set(Rsc.Code, "54321");
```
## Step 6: Printing Resource Information
Print information about the project resources:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Print the resources of " + project.Resources.ParentProject.Get(Prj.Name) + " project.");
Console.WriteLine("Count of resources: " + project.Resources.Count);
foreach (var rsc in project.Resources)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Resource Name: " + rsc.Get(Rsc.Name));
}
```
## Step 7: Deleting Resources
Delete resources from the project:
```csharp
List<Resource> list = project.Resources.ToList();
foreach (var rsc in list)
{
    rsc.Delete();
}
```

## Conclusion
Managing Microsoft Project resource collections using Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides developers with a robust set of tools to efficiently handle project resources programmatically. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly manipulate resources within your projects, enhancing productivity and flexibility in project management tasks.
