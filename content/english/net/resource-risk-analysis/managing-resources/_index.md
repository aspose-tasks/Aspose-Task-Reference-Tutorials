## Introduction
Managing resources efficiently is crucial in project management, especially when dealing with complex schedules and task assignments. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a robust set of tools to handle Microsoft Project resource collections seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into how to manage MS Project resource collections using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET
Firstly, you need to have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [Aspose.Tasks website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided.
### 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have a compatible development environment set up, such as Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.
### 3. Basic Understanding of C# Programming Language
A fundamental understanding of C# programming language is necessary to follow along with the examples provided in this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    
    using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Define the Path to Your Document Directory
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.
## Step 2: Create a New Project Instance
```csharp
var project = new Project();
```
This line initializes a new instance of the `Project` class provided by Aspose.Tasks.
## Step 3: Add Resources to the Project
```csharp
project.Resources.Add("Resource");
```
Here, we are adding a resource named "Resource" to the project. You can replace `"Resource"` with the name of the resource you want to add.
## Step 4: Save the Project
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "CreateResources_out.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```
This step saves the project with the added resources to an XML file. You can change the file name and format according to your requirements.
