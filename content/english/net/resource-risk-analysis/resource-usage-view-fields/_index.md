In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of accessing and utilizing the Resource Usage View Fields using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. If not, you can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Basic Knowledge of C# Programming: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to follow along with the examples.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    
```

## Step 1: Load the Microsoft Project File
Firstly, you need to load the Microsoft Project file. Here's how you can do it:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "ResourceUsageView.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Access the Resource Usage View
Next, you'll access the Resource Usage View. Here's how it's done:
```csharp
var view = (ResourceUsageView)project.Views.ToList()[2];
```
## Step 3: Iterate Through Field Collection
Now, iterate through the Field Collection to access individual fields:
```csharp
foreach (var field in view.FieldCollection)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Field: " + field);
}
```
## Step 4: Transform Collection into List
Optionally, you can transform the collection into a list of ResourceUsageViewField for easier manipulation:
```csharp
// Transform collection into a list of ResourceUsageViewField
IList<ResourceUsageViewField> fields = view.FieldCollection.ToList();
foreach (var field in fields)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Field (from the list): " + field);
}
```
