## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically. One common task in project management is customizing views to display specific information. In this tutorial, we will explore how to customize MS Project resource view columns using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Microsoft Project File: Have a sample MS Project file handy for testing.
3. Development Environment: A development environment set up with .NET framework.
## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces to our project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
using Visualization;
```
## Step 1: Load the Project File
Load the MS Project file using Aspose.Tasks API:
```csharp
var project = new Project("Your_Project_File_Path.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Get Resource and Define Options
Next, get the resource whose view columns you want to customize and define the PDF save options:
```csharp
var resource = project.Resources.GetById(1);
var options = new PdfSaveOptions();
```
## Step 3: Define Custom Columns
Now, define custom columns for the resource view. You can specify various fields and even use delegates for custom calculations:
```csharp
var columns = new List<ViewColumn>
{
    new ResourceViewColumn(100, Field.ResourceName),
    new ResourceViewColumn(100, Field.ResourceActualWork),
    new ResourceViewColumn(100, Field.ResourceCost),
    new ResourceViewColumn(
        "Resource Cost2", 
        80,
        delegate(Resource res)
        {
            return res.Get(Rsc.Cost).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        }),
    new ResourceViewColumn(
        "Resource Cost2", 
        80,
        delegate(Resource res)
        {
            return res.Get(Rsc.Cost).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        }, 
        Field.ResourceCost2)
};
```
## Step 4: Iterate Over Columns
Iterate over the defined columns and display their properties:
```csharp
foreach (var column in columns)
{
    var col = (ResourceViewColumn)column;
    Console.WriteLine("Column Name: " + col.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("Column Field: " + col.Field);
    Console.WriteLine("Column Text: " + col.GetColumnText(resource));
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```
## Step 5: Save the Customized View
Finally, set the custom view and save it as a PDF file:
```csharp
options.View = new ProjectView(columns);
options.PresentationFormat = PresentationFormat.ResourceUsage;
project.Save("Output_PDF_File_Path.pdf", options);
```
By following these steps, you can efficiently customize MS Project resource view columns using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Conclusion
Customizing MS Project resource view columns is essential for displaying relevant information tailored to your project's needs. With Aspose.Tasks for .NET, this task becomes straightforward and efficient, allowing you to create customized views effortlessly.
