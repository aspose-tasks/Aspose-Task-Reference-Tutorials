Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a powerful toolkit for managing Microsoft Project files with ease. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of saving Microsoft Project files as PDFs using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. 
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Installation: Make sure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Basic Understanding: Familiarize yourself with the basics of C# programming language and the .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp

## Step 1: Load the Microsoft Project File
First, we need to load the Microsoft Project file (.mpp) that we want to convert to PDF.
```csharp
var project = new Project("Your_Project_File_Path.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Set PDF Save Options
Define the options for saving the project file as a PDF. You can customize various aspects such as rendering, page selection, etc.
```csharp
var options = new PdfSaveOptions();
options.RenderToSinglePage = false;
options.Pages = new List<int>();
```
## Step 3: Determine Page Count
Before exporting, let's determine the number of pages that can be exported.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Page Count: " + options.PageCount);
```
## Step 4: Select Pages (Optional)
If you want to export specific pages, you can specify them using the `Pages` property. In this example, we're exporting the first and fourth pages.
```csharp
options.Pages.Add(1);
options.Pages.Add(4);
```
## Step 5: Save as PDF
Finally, save the Microsoft Project file as a PDF using the specified options.
```csharp
project.Save("Output_PDF_File_Path.pdf", options);
```
