## Prerequisites
Before diving into using Aspose.Tasks for .NET to save MS Project options as images, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install Aspose.Tasks for .NET
To begin, you need to have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided.
### 2. Obtain a License (Optional)
While Aspose.Tasks for .NET can be used without a license in evaluation mode, obtaining a license is recommended for full functionality and to remove evaluation limitations. You can acquire a license from the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or opt for a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for testing purposes.
### 3. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET Development
A fundamental understanding of C# programming language and .NET framework is necessary to follow along with the examples and integrate Aspose.Tasks functionalities into your applications effectively.
## Import Namespaces
Before we start saving MS Project options as images using Aspose.Tasks for .NET, let's ensure we import the necessary namespaces to our C# project:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory Path
Ensure you have a designated directory for your documents and set the path accordingly:
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the MS Project File
Initialize a new `Project` object by loading the MS Project file:
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "EstimatedMilestoneTasks.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Define Image Save Options
Create an instance of `ImageSaveOptions` and specify the desired settings:
```csharp
var options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.Jpeg)
{
    RenderToSinglePage = false,
    StartDate = project.Get(Prj.StartDate),
    EndDate = project.Get(Prj.FinishDate),
    PageSize = PageSize.Letter
};
```
## Step 4: Specify Pages to Save
If needed, specify the pages to be saved. In this example, we're adding page 2:
```csharp
options.Pages.Add(2);
```
## Step 5: Save the Image
Finally, save the selected pages as an image with the specified options:
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "SaveSelectedPagesImageSaveOptions_page2_out.jpeg", options);
```

## Conclusion
Aspose.Tasks for .NET simplifies the process of working with MS Project files, allowing developers to effortlessly manipulate project tasks. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently save MS Project options as images within your .NET applications.
