## Introduction
Microsoft Project (MSP) is a widely-used tool for project management, facilitating the planning, tracking, and reporting of project activities. Aspose.Tasks for .NET offers robust functionality to manipulate MSP files programmatically, empowering developers to automate various tasks related to project management. In this tutorial, we'll delve into leveraging Aspose.Tasks for .NET to generate XPS files from MSP documents, exploring the necessary steps and considerations.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Microsoft Project Document: Prepare the Microsoft Project document (.mpp) you intend to convert to XPS format.

## Import Namespaces
To kickstart the process, import the required namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
```

## Step 1: Set the Document Directory Path
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where your MSP document is located.
## Step 2: Load the MSP Document
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "EstimatedMilestoneTasks.mpp");
```
Here, we initialize a new `Project` object by passing the path of the MSP document.
## Step 3: Create XPS Save Options
```csharp
// Create XPS save options and tune the parameters
var options = new XpsOptions
{
    RenderMetafileAsBitmap = true
};
```
In this step, we instantiate `XpsOptions` and configure parameters. Setting `RenderMetafileAsBitmap` to `true` ensures proper rendering of metafiles.
## Step 4: Save the Document as XPS
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "UseSvgOptions_out.xps", options);
```
Finally, we call the `Save` method on the `Project` object, specifying the output file path and the previously configured `XpsOptions`.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Aspose.Tasks for .NET simplifies the process of converting Microsoft Project documents to XPS format programmatically. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, developers can seamlessly integrate this functionality into their .NET applications, enhancing project management workflows with ease.
