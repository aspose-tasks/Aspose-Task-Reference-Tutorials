## Step 1: Load the Project File
Firstly, you need to load the MS Project file using Aspose.Tasks:

## Step 3: Customize View Columns
You can customize view columns such as Gantt chart, resource view, and assignment view. Here's how to add columns to each:
```csharp
var ganttChartColumn = new GanttChartColumn("WBS", 100, delegate(Task task) { return task.Get(Tsk.WBS); });
options.View.Columns.Add(ganttChartColumn);
var resourceViewColumn = new ResourceViewColumn("Cost center", 100, delegate(Resource resource) { return resource.Get(Rsc.CostCenter); });
options.ResourceView.Columns.Add(resourceViewColumn);
var assignmentViewColumn = new AssignmentViewColumn("Notes", 200, delegate(ResourceAssignment assignment) { return assignment.Get(Asn.NotesText); });
options.AssignmentView.Columns.Add(assignmentViewColumn);
```
## Step 4: Save the Project with Options
Finally, save the project with the specified options:
```csharp
project.Save("Your Document Directory/UsingSpreadsheet2003SaveOptions_out.xml", options);
