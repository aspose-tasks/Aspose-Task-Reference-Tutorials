## Introduction
Microsoft Project (MS Project) is a powerful tool for project management, and Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides seamless integration for working with MS Project files programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of configuring MS Project XLSX options using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
### 1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Installed
Make sure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from the [Aspose.Tasks for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
### 2. Basic Understanding of C# and .NET Framework
Familiarity with C# programming language and the .NET framework is required to follow along with this tutorial.
### 3. Microsoft Project File
Have a Microsoft Project file (MPP) ready that you want to configure and save as an XLSX file.

## Importing Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
    using System.Text;
    using NUnit.Framework;
    using Saving;
    using Visualization;
```

## Step 1: Load the Project
```csharp
var project = new Project("YourProjectFile.mpp");
```
Load the Microsoft Project file you want to configure.
## Step 2: Define XlsxOptions
```csharp
var options = new XlsxOptions();
```
Create an instance of `XlsxOptions` to configure settings for saving as XLSX.
## Step 3: Add Gantt Chart Columns
```csharp
var col = new GanttChartColumn("WBS", 100, delegate(Task task) { return task.Get(Tsk.WBS); });
options.View.Columns.Add(col);
```
Add desired Gantt Chart columns to the options.
## Step 4: Add Resource View Columns
```csharp
var rscCol = new ResourceViewColumn("Cost center", 100, delegate(Resource resource) { return resource.Get(Rsc.CostCenter); });
options.ResourceView.Columns.Add(rscCol);
```
Include desired columns for the resource view in the options.
## Step 5: Add Assignment View Columns
```csharp
var assnCol = new AssignmentViewColumn("Notes", 200, delegate(ResourceAssignment assignment) { return assignment.Get(Asn.NotesText); });
options.AssignmentView.Columns.Add(assnCol);
```
Add desired columns for the assignment view in the options.
## Step 6: Set Encoding
```csharp
options.Encoding = Encoding.Unicode;
```
Set the encoding for the output file.
## Step 7: Save the Project as XLSX
```csharp
project.Save("OutputFile.xlsx", options);
```
Save the project with the configured options as an XLSX file.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to configure MS Project XLSX options using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can customize the output format according to your requirements, enhancing the flexibility and usability of your project management workflow.
