## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, managing project tasks efficiently is crucial for successful project completion. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a powerful solution for handling project management tasks seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into configuring MS Project XAML options using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. 
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Knowledge of C# Programming: This tutorial requires a basic understanding of C# programming language.
2. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. MS Project File: Prepare a sample MS Project file (.mpp) that you will use for configuration.
## Import Namespaces
Before we proceed with the tutorial, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```
## Step 1: Define the Document Directory Path
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory where the MS Project file is located.
## Step 2: Load the MS Project File
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```
This code initializes a new instance of the Project class and loads the MS Project file named "Project2.mpp" from the specified directory.
## Step 3: Configure XAML Save Options
```csharp
SaveOptions options = new XamlOptions();
options.FitContent = true;
options.LegendOnEachPage = false;
options.Timescale = Timescale.ThirdsOfMonths;
```
Here, we create an instance of XamlOptions and configure various options such as fitting content, disabling legend on each page, and setting the timescale to thirds of months.
## Step 4: Save the Project with Configured Options
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "RenderXAMLWithOptions_out.xaml", options);
```
Finally, we save the project with the configured XAML options to an output XAML file named "RenderXAMLWithOptions_out.xaml".
## Conclusion
In conclusion, configuring MS Project XAML options in Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a straightforward process that enhances flexibility and customization in project management. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently manage project tasks according to your requirements.
