## Introduction
Welcome to the step-by-step guide on handling task links in Aspose.Tasks for .NET! Task links play a crucial role in project management, allowing you to establish relationships between tasks and create dependencies. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of working with task link collections using Aspose.Tasks.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Sample Project File: Prepare a sample project file (e.g., "SampleProject.mpp") to follow along with the examples.
Now, let's get started!
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.Tasks:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    
```
## Step 1: Load the Project and Access Tasks
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the project
var project = new Project(DataDir + "SampleProject.mpp");
// Access tasks by ID
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
var task2 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(2);
var task3 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(3);
var task4 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(4);
var task5 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(5);
```
## Step 2: Create Task Links
Link the tasks together to establish dependencies:
```csharp
// Link tasks using FinishToStart dependency
project.TaskLinks.Add(task1, task2);
project.TaskLinks.Add(task2, task3, TaskLinkType.FinishToStart);
project.TaskLinks.Add(task3, task4, TaskLinkType.FinishToStart);
project.TaskLinks.Add(task4, task5, TaskLinkType.FinishToStart, project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day));
project.TaskLinks.Add(task2, task5, TaskLinkType.FinishToStart, project.GetDuration(2, TimeUnitType.Day));
```
## Step 3: Print Task Links
Print the task links for the project:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Print task links of " + project.TaskLinks.ParentProject.Get(Prj.Name) + " project.");
Console.WriteLine("Task links count: " + project.TaskLinks.Count);
// Iterate through task links
foreach (var link in project.TaskLinks)
{
    Console.WriteLine("From ID = " + link.PredTask.Get(Tsk.Id) + " => To ID = " + link.SuccTask.Get(Tsk.Id));
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```
## Step 4: Edit Task Link
Edit a task link by index access:
```csharp
project.TaskLinks[0].LagFormat = TimeUnitType.Hour;
```
## Step 5: Remove Task Links
Remove all task links from the project:
```csharp
List<TaskLink> taskLinks = project.TaskLinks.ToList();
foreach (var link in taskLinks)
{
    project.TaskLinks.Remove(link);
}
```
