## Introduction
If you're delving into the world of project management using .NET, Aspose.Tasks is your go-to solution for seamless handling of task collections. This tutorial will guide you through the process of managing task collections efficiently, ensuring you make the most out of this powerful library.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET library downloaded and referenced in your project.
## Import Namespaces
To begin, let's import the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
	using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
These namespaces provide access to essential classes and methods required for effective task management.
Now, let's break down the tutorial into a series of steps, ensuring clarity and simplicity.
## Step 1: Creating a Project Instance
```csharp
var project = new Project();
```
Instantiate a new project using the `Project` class.
## Step 2: Checking Task Collection Readiness
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Is task collection read-only: " + project.RootTask.Children.IsReadOnly);
```
Verify if the task collection is read-only.
## Step 3: Creating Tasks
```csharp
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.Add();
task1.Set(Tsk.Name, "Task 1");
// Set additional task properties like start, duration, and finish
// Similar steps for Task 2 and Task 3
```
Create tasks within the project and set their properties.
## Step 4: Printing Project Tasks
```csharp
foreach (var child in project.RootTask.Children)
{
    // Print task details
    Console.WriteLine("Task name: " + child.Get(Tsk.Name));
    Console.WriteLine("Task start: " + child.Get(Tsk.Start));
    Console.WriteLine("Task duration: " + child.Get(Tsk.Duration));
    Console.WriteLine("Task finish: " + child.Get(Tsk.Finish));
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```
Print the details of each task within the project.
## Step 5: Editing Tasks
```csharp
var task1ToEdit = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
task1ToEdit.Set(Tsk.Name, "Task 1 (Edited)");
var taskToEdit2 = project.RootTask.Children.GetByUid(2);
taskToEdit2.Set(Tsk.Name, "Task 2 (Edited)");
```
Edit tasks using their ID or UID.
## Step 6: Adding a Recurring Task
```csharp
var parameters = new RecurringTaskParameters
{
    // Set recurring task parameters
};
var recurring = project.RootTask.Children.Add(parameters);
Console.WriteLine("Task name: " + recurring.Get(Tsk.Name));
```
Add a recurring task to the project.
## Step 7: Converting Collection to a List
```csharp
List<Task> tasks = project.RootTask.Children.ToList();
foreach (var task in tasks)
{
    task.Delete();
}
```
Convert the task collection into a list and perform operations on each task.
## Conclusion
Managing task collections in Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a breeze with this step-by-step guide. Whether you're creating, editing, or deleting tasks, Aspose.Tasks empowers you to handle project management seamlessly.
