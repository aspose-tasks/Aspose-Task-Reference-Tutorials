## Introduction
In the dynamic world of project management, staying organized and informed is crucial. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a powerful solution for handling task baselines, allowing you to access valuable baseline information efficiently. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you grasp each concept with clarity.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Environment Setup: Ensure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from the [Aspose.Tasks documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics, as this tutorial assumes a foundational understanding.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use a preferred IDE such as Visual Studio to follow along seamlessly.
## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This ensures you have access to the Aspose.Tasks functionality:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    
```
Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps to guide you through handling task baselines in Aspose.Tasks.
## Step 1: Create a Project
```csharp
var project = new Project();
```
Start by initializing a new project using the `Project` class.
## Step 2: Create a Task and Set Baseline
```csharp
var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task");
project.SetBaseline(BaselineType.Baseline);
```
Add a task to the project and set its baseline using the `SetBaseline` method.
## Step 3: Display Task Baseline Information
```csharp
var baseline = task.Baselines.ToList()[0];
Console.WriteLine("Baseline Start: {0}", baseline.Start);
Console.WriteLine("Baseline duration: {0}", baseline.Duration);
Console.WriteLine("Baseline duration format: {0}", baseline.Duration.TimeUnit);
Console.WriteLine("Is it estimated duration?: {0}", baseline.EstimatedDuration);
Console.WriteLine("Baseline Finish: {0}", baseline.Finish);
```
Retrieve and display key information about the task baseline, such as start time, duration, and finish time.
## Step 4: Additional Baseline Details
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Interim: {0}", baseline.Interim);
Console.WriteLine("Fixed Cost: {0}", baseline.FixedCost);
```
Explore additional details, including whether the baseline is an Interim Baseline and the fixed cost associated with it.
## Step 5: Print Timephased Data
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Number of timephased items: " + baseline.TimephasedData.Count);
foreach (var data in baseline.TimephasedData)
{
    Console.WriteLine(" Uid: " + data.Uid);
    Console.WriteLine(" Start: " + data.Start);
    Console.WriteLine(" Finish: " + data.Finish);
}
```
Understand the timephased data associated with the task baseline, providing insights into various project timelines.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to handle task baselines in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. This knowledge will enhance your project management capabilities, ensuring accurate tracking and planning.
