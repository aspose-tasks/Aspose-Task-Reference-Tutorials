Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Load Project and Set Project Properties
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
project.Set(Prj.NewTasksAreManual, false);
```
## Step 2: Access Gantt Chart View

var view = (GanttChartView)project.Views.ToList()[0];
```
## Step 3: Customize Task Name Text Style
```csharp
var style1 = new TableTextStyle(1);
style1.Field = Field.TaskName;
style1.Font = new FontDescriptor("Impact", 12F, FontStyles.Bold | FontStyles.Italic);
view.TableTextStyles.Add(style1);
```
## Step 4: Customize Task Duration Text Style
```csharp
var style2 = new TableTextStyle(2);
style2.Field = Field.TaskDurationText;
style2.Font = new FontDescriptor("Impact", 16F, FontStyles.Underline);
view.TableTextStyles.Add(style2);
```
## Step 5: Save the Project with Custom Styles
```csharp
SimpleSaveOptions options = new MPPSaveOptions
{
    WriteViewData = true
};
project.Save(DataDir + "WorkWithTableTextStyle_out.mpp", options);
```
## Step 6: Handle License Exception
```csharp
catch (NotSupportedException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(
        ex.Message
        + "\nThis example will only work if you apply a valid Aspose License. You can purchase a full license or get a 30-day temporary license from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/purchase/default.aspx).");
