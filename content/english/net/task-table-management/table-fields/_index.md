## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.Tasks for .NET, a powerful library that enables seamless manipulation of Microsoft Project files in your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of handling table fields in Aspose.Tasks, allowing you to efficiently read and manage project tables. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, this step-by-step guide will empower you to harness the full potential of Aspose.Tasks.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Tasks Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Development Environment: Ensure you have a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio, set up on your machine.
Now, let's jump into the nitty-gritty of handling table fields.
## Import Namespaces
First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our project:
```csharp
    using System;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Set the Document Directory
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your project files are located.
## Step 2: Read Project Tables
Now, let's read the project tables using the following code:
```csharp
// Shows how to read project tables.
var project = new Project(DataDir + "ReadTableData.mpp");
```
This code initializes the `Project` object with the specified Microsoft Project file.
## Step 3: Get the Table
```csharp
// get the table
var table = project.Tables.ToList()[0];
```
Here, we retrieve the first table from the project. You can modify the index based on your project requirements.
## Step 4: Display Table Fields Information
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Print table fields of {0}", table.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Table Fields Count" + table.TableFields.Count);
// display all table fields' information
foreach (var field in table.TableFields)
{
    Console.WriteLine("  Field: " + field.Field);
    Console.WriteLine("  Width: " + field.Width);
    Console.WriteLine("  Title: " + field.Title);
    Console.WriteLine("  Title Alignment: " + field.AlignTitle);
    Console.WriteLine("  Data Alignment: " + field.AlignData);
    Console.WriteLine("  Wrap Header: " + field.WrapHeader);
    Console.WriteLine("  Wrap Text: " + field.WrapText);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```
This code snippet prints detailed information about each table field, including field name, width, title, alignment, and text wrapping properties.
Repeat these steps as needed, and you'll be able to effectively handle table fields in Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
