## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.Tasks for .NET, a powerful library that facilitates seamless manipulation and management of project tasks. In this tutorial, we will delve into the fascinating realm of task baselinesâ€”a crucial aspect of project planning and tracking. By the end of this guide, you will master the art of working with task baseline collections, enabling you to enhance your project management capabilities.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [official release page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up your preferred .NET development environment.
- Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is beneficial.
Now that we're all set, let's jump into the exciting world of Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## 1. Set Up Project and Task
Begin by creating a new project and adding a task to it:
```csharp
var project = new Project();
var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task");
```
## 2. Create Project Baselines
Now, let's create project baselines for the task:
```csharp
project.SetBaseline(BaselineType.Baseline);
```
## 3. Print Task Baselines
Print information about the task baselines:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Count of task baselines: " + task.Baselines.Count);
foreach (var baseline in task.Baselines)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Baseline duration: {0}", baseline.Duration);
    Console.WriteLine("Baseline start: {0}", baseline.Start);
    Console.WriteLine("Baseline finish: {0}", baseline.Finish);
}
```
## 4. Clear All Baselines
If needed, you can clear all baselines associated with the task:
```csharp
List<TaskBaseline> baselines = task.Baselines.ToList();
for (var i = 0; i < baselines.Count; i++)
{
    task.Baselines.Remove(baselines[i]);
}
```
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the process of working with task baselines using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
