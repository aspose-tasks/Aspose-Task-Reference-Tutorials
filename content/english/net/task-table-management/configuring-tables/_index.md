## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on configuring tables in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft Project files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of configuring tables using Aspose.Tasks, breaking down each step for a clear understanding.
## Prerequisites
Before we delve into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Tasks library installed. You can download it from the official [Aspose.Tasks .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred .NET development tool.
- Sample Project File: Have a sample Microsoft Project file (MPP) ready for testing.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, start by importing the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.Tasks. Add the following lines at the beginning of your code:
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using NUnit.Framework;
    using Saving;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.
## Step 1: Define the Document Directory
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the Project File
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project1.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Access the Table for Editing
```csharp
var table = project.Tables.ToList()[0];
Console.WriteLine("Uid of the table: " + table.Uid);
Console.WriteLine("Index of the table: " + table.Index);
Console.WriteLine("Name of the table: " + table.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Type of the table: " + table.TableType);
```
## Step 4: Tune Table Properties
```csharp
table.AdjustHeaderRowHeight = true;
table.DateFormat = DateFormat.DateDdMmYyyy;
table.LockFirstColumn = true;
table.RowHeight = 10;
table.ShowAddNewColumn = true;
table.ShowInMenu = true;
```
## Step 5: Save the Updated Table
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "WorkWithTable_out.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully configured tables in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. This tutorial covered essential steps to modify table properties and save the changes to a new project file.
