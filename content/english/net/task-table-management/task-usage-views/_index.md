## Introduction
In the realm of project management, visualizing task usage is pivotal for effective planning and execution. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a robust solution for rendering task usage views, allowing you to customize timescale settings and presentation formats. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to configure task usage views using Aspose.Tasks.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Tasks library integrated into your .NET project. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. .NET Environment: Have a working .NET environment set up on your machine.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Tasks functionalities. Add the following lines to your code:
```csharp
    using System;
    using NUnit.Framework;
    using Saving;
    using Visualization;
```
## Step 1: Set the Document Directory Path
Before working with the Aspose.Tasks functionalities, set the path to your documents directory. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the Project
Initialize the Aspose.Tasks `Project` object by loading your project file (e.g., TaskUsageView.mpp).
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskUsageView.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Define SaveOptions
Create a `SaveOptions` object to specify the rendering options. Set the timescale to 'Days' and the presentation format to 'TaskUsage'.
```csharp
SaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    Timescale = Timescale.Days,
    PresentationFormat = PresentationFormat.TaskUsage
};
```
## Step 4: Save with Days Timescale
Save the project with the predefined timescale settings of 'Days'.
```csharp
var outputProject = "TaskUsageView_result_days_out.pdf";
project.Save(DataDir + outputProject, options);
```
## Step 5: Save with ThirdsOfMonths Timescale
Change the timescale settings to 'ThirdsOfMonths' and save the project.
```csharp
options.Timescale = Timescale.ThirdsOfMonths;
outputProject = "TaskUsageView_result_thirdsOfMonths_out.pdf";
project.Save(DataDir + outputProject, options);
```
## Step 6: Save with Months Timescale
Set the timescale to 'Months' and save the project with the updated settings.
```csharp
options.Timescale = Timescale.Months;
outputProject = "TaskUsageView_result_months_out.pdf";
project.Save(DataDir + outputProject, options);
```
## Conclusion
Configuring task usage views with Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a straightforward process. By customizing timescale settings, you can tailor the visualization of your project tasks according to your specific needs.
