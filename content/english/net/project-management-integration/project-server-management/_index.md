## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into managing MS Project Server using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically, allowing for seamless integration and manipulation of project data.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into managing MS Project Server with Aspose.Tasks, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Microsoft Project Server: You need access to a Microsoft Project Server instance where you have administrative privileges or at least permissions to create and manage projects.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Make sure you have downloaded and installed the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Credentials: Obtain the necessary credentials to authenticate with your MS Project Server instance. This typically includes a username and password.
## Import Namespaces
Before getting started, ensure you have imported the required namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Net;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Authentication Credentials
First, you need to set up authentication credentials to connect to your MS Project Server instance. This includes the domain address, username, and password.
```csharp
const string sharepointDomainAddress = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/pwa";
const string UserName = "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com";
const string Password = "MyPassword";
var credentials = new ProjectServerCredentials(sharepointDomainAddress, UserName, Password);
```
## Step 2: Load the Project
Next, load the MS Project file that you want to manage using Aspose.Tasks.
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + @"Project1.mpp");
```
## Step 3: Create Project Server Manager
Instantiate a `ProjectServerManager` object using the previously defined credentials.
```csharp
var manager = new ProjectServerManager(credentials);
```
## Step 4: Define Save Options
Define any specific save options for your project. For example, you can set a timeout for the operation.
```csharp
var options = new ProjectServerSaveOptions
{
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)
};
```
## Step 5: Create or Update Project
Finally, create or update the project on the MS Project Server.
```csharp
manager.CreateNewProject(project, options);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully managed MS Project Server using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
