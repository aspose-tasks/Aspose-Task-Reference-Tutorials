## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to work with Microsoft Project data using the Aspose.Tasks library for .NET. Aspose.Tasks provides powerful features to manipulate project files, including creating tasks, adding resources, setting properties, and saving projects in various formats.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Development Environment: Make sure you have a .NET development environment set up.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces
Before working with Aspose.Tasks, import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using System.Drawing.Printing;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using Connectivity;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
using Visualization;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Project Object
```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project();
```
This line initializes a new instance of the `Project` class, which represents a Microsoft Project file.
## Step 2: Set Project Properties
```csharp
project.Set(Prj.WorkFormat, TimeUnitType.Hour);
project.Set(Prj.NewTasksAreManual, false);
```
These lines demonstrate how to set properties of the project such as work format and task creation mode.
## Step 3: Adding Tasks
```csharp
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 1");
```
Here, a new task named "Task 1" is added to the root task of the project.
## Step 4: Setting Task Properties
```csharp
task1.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 2, 5, 8, 0, 0));
task1.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(8, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task1.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 2, 5, 17, 0, 0));
```
These lines set the start date, duration, and finish date for "Task 1".
## Step 5: Adding Resources
```csharp
var workResource = project.Resources.Add("Work Resource");
workResource.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);
```
This part demonstrates how to add a work resource to the project.
## Step 6: Assigning Resources to Tasks
```csharp
var workResourceAssignment = project.ResourceAssignments.Add(task1, workResource);
workResourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Start, new DateTime(2020, 2, 5, 8, 0, 0));
workResourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Work, project.GetWork(8));
workResourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 2, 5, 17, 0, 0));
```
These lines show how to assign the previously added work resource to "Task 1" with specific start, work, and finish dates.
## Step 7: Saving Project
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "ProjectCreation_out.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```
Finally, the project is saved in Microsoft Project XML file format.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to work with Microsoft Project data using the Aspose.Tasks library in .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can manipulate project files, add tasks, resources, assign resources to tasks, and save projects in various formats.
