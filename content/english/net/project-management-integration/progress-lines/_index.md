## Introduction
Microsoft Project (MS Project) is a powerful tool for project management, allowing users to track various aspects of their projects. One crucial feature of MS Project is the ability to visualize progress lines, which help stakeholders understand the project's status and trajectory. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to handle progress lines in MS Project using the Aspose.Tasks library for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio or any other preferred .NET development environment.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.

## Importing Namespaces
To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Drawing;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```
Now, let's break down each step in handling progress lines:
## Step 1: Load the Project File
```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
project.Set(Prj.StatusDate, project.Get(Prj.StartDate));
```
Here, we load the MS Project file `Project2.mpp` and set its status date.
## Step 2: Define the Gantt Chart View
```csharp
var view = (GanttChartView)project.Views.ToList()[0];
```
We cast the project's view to a Gantt chart view for further manipulation.
## Step 3: Define Progress Lines
```csharp
view.ProgressLines = new ProgressLines();
var progressLines = view.ProgressLines;
```
We initialize the progress lines for the Gantt chart view.
## Step 4: Configure Progress Line Settings
```csharp
progressLines.BeginAtDate = project.Get(Prj.StatusDate);
progressLines.BeginAtProjectStart = true;
progressLines.DateFormat = DateLabel.DayDddd;
progressLines.DisplayAtCurrentDate = true;
progressLines.DisplayAtRecurringIntervals = true;
progressLines.DisplaySelected = true;
progressLines.IsBaselinePlan = false;
progressLines.Font = new FontDescriptor("Arial", 10);
progressLines.LineColor = Color.Aquamarine;
progressLines.LinePattern = LinePattern.Dashed;
progressLines.OtherLineColor = Color.Azure;
progressLines.OtherLinePattern = LinePattern.Dotted;
progressLines.OtherProgressPointColor = Color.Red;
progressLines.OtherProgressPointShape = GanttBarEndShape.Circle;
progressLines.ProgressPointColor = Color.Orange;
progressLines.ProgressPointShape = GanttBarEndShape.Diamond;
progressLines.RecurringInterval = new RecurringInterval();
progressLines.RecurringInterval.Interval = Interval.Daily;
progressLines.RecurringInterval.DailyDayNumber = 1;
progressLines.ShowDate = true;
```
Here, we set various properties for the progress lines, such as line color, pattern, font, etc.
## Step 5: Check Progress Lines Configuration
```csharp
// Output progress lines settings
Console.WriteLine("Begin At Date: " + progressLines.BeginAtDate);
Console.WriteLine("Begin At Project Start: " + progressLines.BeginAtProjectStart);
// Output other settings...
```
We output the configured progress lines settings for verification.
## Step 6: Save the Project File
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "WorkWithProgressLines_out.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
Finally, we save the modified project file with progress lines.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to handle MS Project progress lines using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can effectively customize and visualize progress lines in your MS Project files programmatically.
