## Introduction
Microsoft Project is a powerful tool for project management, allowing users to organize tasks, manage resources, and track progress effectively. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a convenient way to work with Microsoft Project files programmatically, enabling developers to customize project views to suit their specific needs. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to customize MS Project views using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
### 1. Install Aspose.Tasks for .NET
You can download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library in your development environment.
### 2. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET Framework
Familiarize yourself with C# programming language and the .NET Framework, as this tutorial assumes a basic understanding of these concepts.
### 3. Microsoft Project File
Prepare a Microsoft Project file (.mpp) that you'll use for customization. Ensure you have the file path handy for reference in your C# code.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```
Now let's break down the example provided into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Load the Microsoft Project File
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```
Load the Microsoft Project file into a `Project` object using its file path.
## Step 2: Customize Save Options
```csharp
SaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    Timescale = Timescale.Months,
    View = ProjectView.GetDefaultAssignmentView()
};
```
Customize the save options according to your requirements. In this example, we're setting the timescale to months and using the default assignment view.
## Step 3: Save the Customized View
```csharp
project.Save(OutDir + "WorkWithProjectView_AssignmentView_out.pdf", options);
```
Save the customized view of the project to a PDF file with the specified options.
