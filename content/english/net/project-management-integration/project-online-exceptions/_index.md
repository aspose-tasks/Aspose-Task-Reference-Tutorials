## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory
Ensure you have a designated directory to work with your Project files. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory.
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Define Project Server Credentials
Set up the URL, domain, username, and password for your Project Server.

```csharp
var projectServerCredentials = new ProjectServerCredentials(URL, windowsCredentials);
```
## Step 6: Initialize Project Server Manager
Initialize a Project Server Manager object with the Project Server credentials.
```csharp
var manager = new ProjectServerManager(projectServerCredentials);
```
## Step 7: Create New Project
Create a new project on the Project Server using the loaded Project object.
```csharp
