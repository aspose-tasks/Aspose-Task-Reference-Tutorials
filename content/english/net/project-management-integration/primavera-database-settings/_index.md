## Introduction
Are you ready to harness the power of Aspose.Tasks for .NET to configure MS Project Primavera Database settings seamlessly? In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step. But before we dive in, let's ensure you have everything you need.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
### 1. Install Aspose.Tasks for .NET
Head over to [Download Aspose.Tasks for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/) and grab the latest version of the Aspose.Tasks library. Follow the installation instructions provided to set it up in your .NET environment.
### 2. Access MS Project Primavera Database
Ensure you have access to the MS Project Primavera Database. You'll need the necessary credentials and connection details to proceed.
### 3. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET Framework
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming language and the .NET Framework.

## Import Namespaces
Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project.

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Aspose.Tasks.Connectivity;

```
This line imports the `System.Data.SqlClient` namespace, which contains classes for working with SQL Server databases in .NET applications.

Now that you've set up the prerequisites and imported the required namespaces, let's break down the example code provided for configuring MS Project Primavera Database settings using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Step 1: Create SqlConnectionStringBuilder Object
```csharp
var sb = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder();
sb.DataSource = "192.168.56.3,1433";
sb.Encrypt = true;
sb.TrustServerCertificate = true;
sb.InitialCatalog = "PrimaveraEDB";
sb.NetworkLibrary = "DBMSSOCN";
sb.UserID = "privuser";
sb.Password = "***";
sb.ConnectTimeout = 2; // ExSkip
```
This code creates a `SqlConnectionStringBuilder` object and sets various properties such as `DataSource`, `Encrypt`, `InitialCatalog`, `UserID`, `Password`, etc., to configure the connection string for the Primavera database.
## Step 2: Initialize PrimaveraDbSettings Object
```csharp
var settings = new PrimaveraDbSettings(sb.ConnectionString, 4502);
```
Here, we initialize a new instance of the `PrimaveraDbSettings` class by passing the connection string and the project ID (in this case, `4502`) as parameters.
## Step 3: Read Project from Database
```csharp
var project = new Project(settings);
```
This line creates a new `Project` object by passing the `settings` object we created earlier. It establishes a connection to the Primavera database and reads the project with the specified UID (`4502`).
## Step 4: Display Project UID
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Project UID to read: " + settings.ProjectId);
```
Finally, this code prints the UID of the project being read to the console.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned how to configure MS Project Primavera Database settings using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. With this knowledge, you can efficiently integrate Aspose.Tasks into your .NET applications and streamline project management tasks.
