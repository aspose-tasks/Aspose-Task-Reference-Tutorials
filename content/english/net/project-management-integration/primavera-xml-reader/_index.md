## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize the MS Project Primavera XML Reader in Aspose.Tasks for .NET to effectively manage project data. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that enables .NET applications to work with Microsoft Project files without requiring Microsoft Project to be installed.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Microsoft Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio installed on your system to follow along with the examples.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is necessary to understand and implement the code examples.

## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a new project in Visual Studio and ensure that you have referenced the Aspose.Tasks DLL in your project.
## Step 2: Accessing Project Data
Instantiate the PrimaveraXmlReader class by passing the path to your Primavera XML file:
```csharp
var reader = new PrimaveraXmlReader(DataDir + "primavera.xml");
```
## Step 3: Retrieve Project UIDs
Use the GetProjectUids() method to retrieve the list of project UIDs from the Primavera XML file:
```csharp
List<int> projectUids = reader.GetProjectUids();
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Project UIDs
Loop through the list of project UIDs and print them:
```csharp
foreach (var projectUid in projectUids)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Project UID: " + projectUid);
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to utilize the MS Project Primavera XML Reader in Aspose.Tasks for .NET to access and manage project data efficiently. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Aspose.Tasks into your .NET applications for enhanced project management capabilities.
