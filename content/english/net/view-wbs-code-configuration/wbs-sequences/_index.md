## Introduction
Are you working on a project management application and need a robust tool to handle Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) sequences? Look no further than Aspose.Tasks for .NET, a powerful library that simplifies project management tasks. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of defining WBS sequences step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- [Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/)
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
- A development environment set up for .NET projects
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, make sure to include the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionality of Aspose.Tasks. Add the following at the beginning of your script:
```csharp
    using NUnit.Framework;
    using Saving;
```
## Defining WBS Sequences - Step by Step Guide
## Step 1: Set up the Project
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project();
```
## Step 2: Configure WBS Code Definition
```csharp
project.WBSCodeDefinition = new WBSCodeDefinition();
project.WBSCodeDefinition.GenerateWBSCode = true;
project.WBSCodeDefinition.VerifyUniqueness = true;
project.WBSCodeDefinition.CodePrefix = "CRS-";
```
## Step 3: Define WBS Code Masks
```csharp
var mask = new WBSCodeMask();
mask.Length = 2;
mask.Separator = "-";
mask.Sequence = WBSSequence.OrderedNumbers;
project.WBSCodeDefinition.CodeMaskCollection.Add(mask);
mask = new WBSCodeMask();
mask.Length = 1;
mask.Separator = "-";
mask.Sequence = WBSSequence.OrderedUppercaseLetters;
project.WBSCodeDefinition.CodeMaskCollection.Add(mask);
```
## Step 4: Add Tasks to the Project
```csharp
var tsk = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 1");
tsk.Children.Add("Task 2");
```
## Step 5: Recalculate Project Data
```csharp
project.Recalculate();
```
## Step 6: Save the Project
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + @"AddWBSCodes_out.xml", SaveFileFormat.Xml);
```
Congratulations! You have successfully defined WBS sequences in your project using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Conclusion
Managing WBS sequences is crucial for effective project management, and Aspose.Tasks for .NET makes this task seamless. By following these simple steps, you can enhance the WBS functionality in your project management application.
