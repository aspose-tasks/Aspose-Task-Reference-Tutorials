```csharp
string fileVersion = versionInfo.FileVersion;
Console.WriteLine("File Version: " + fileVersion);
```

### Step 4: Retrieving Assembly Version

Now, let's retrieve the assembly version.

```csharp
string assemblyVersion = versionInfo.AssemblyVersion;
Console.WriteLine("Assembly Version: " + assemblyVersion);
```

### Step 5: Retrieving Assembly Informational Version

Lastly, we'll retrieve the assembly informational version.

```csharp
string assemblyInformationalVersion = versionInfo.AssemblyInformationalVersion;
Console.WriteLine("Assembly Informational Version: " + assemblyInformationalVersion);
```
