## Introduction

Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft Project files in their .NET applications seamlessly. Among its many features, it provides robust support for managing baselines within projects. Baselines are essential for project management as they allow you to compare the original project plan with the current status, enabling better tracking and analysis of project progress.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into working with baseline collections in Aspose.Tasks, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Basic understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with the C# programming language.
4. Microsoft Project file: Have a Microsoft Project file (.mpp) ready for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

To start working with baseline collections in Aspose.Tasks, you need to import the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using NUnit.Framework;

```

Now, let's break down each example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load Project File

First, load the Microsoft Project file using Aspose.Tasks:

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "WorkWithBaselineCollection.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Get Resource

Next, retrieve the desired resource from the project:

```csharp
var resource = project.Resources.GetByUid(1);
```

## Step 3: Display Baseline Information

Now, display information about the baselines associated with the resource:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Count of assignment baselines: " + resource.Baselines.Count);
Console.WriteLine("Parent Resource Name: " + resource.Baselines.ParentResource.Get(Rsc.Name));
```

## Step 4: Iterate Through Baselines

Iterate through each baseline associated with the resource and print relevant information:

```csharp
foreach (var baseline in resource.Baselines)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Baseline Number: " + baseline.BaselineNumber);
    Console.WriteLine("Cost: " + baseline.Cost);
    Console.WriteLine("Work: " + baseline.Work);
    Console.WriteLine("BCWP: " + baseline.Bcwp);
    Console.WriteLine("BCWS: " + baseline.Bcws);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Step 5: Remove Baselines

Delete all baselines associated with the resource:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Delete all baselines: ");
List<Baseline> baselines = resource.Baselines.ToList();
foreach (var baseline in baselines)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Delete baseline with name: " + baseline.BaselineNumber);
    resource.Baselines.Remove(baseline);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to work with baseline collections in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily manage baselines within your .NET applications, allowing for effective project tracking and analysis.
