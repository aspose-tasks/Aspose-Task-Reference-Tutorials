## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into handling the `BitmapInvalidSizeException` when working with Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that allows developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically, enabling tasks such as saving projects as images. However, occasionally, when attempting to save a project as an image, we might encounter an `Invalid Size Exception` related to the bitmap. This tutorial aims to guide you through the process of catching and handling this exception effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Basic understanding of C# programming language.
2. Installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
3. Familiarity with working with Microsoft Project files.

## Import Namespaces

Before starting, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
using Visualization;

```

## Step 1: Initialize Project and Define View

Firstly, initialize a `Project` object and define a view, such as the `GanttChartView`.

```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Blank2010.mpp");
GanttChartView view = (GanttChartView) project.Views.ToList()[0];
```

## Step 2: Specify Image Save Options

Next, specify the options for saving the image, including the format and timescale.

```csharp
var options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.Png)
{
    Timescale = Timescale.DefinedInView
};
```

## Step 3: Set Timescale Unit and Count

Adjust the timescale unit and count according to your requirements. In this example, we set the timescale to minutes.

```csharp
view.MiddleTimescaleTier.Unit = TimescaleUnit.Minutes;
view.MiddleTimescaleTier.Count = 1;
```

## Step 4: Save Project as Image

Attempt to save the project as an image using the specified options.

```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "SaveToStreamAndCatchException_out.mpp", options);
```

## Step 5: Catch and Handle Exception

Implement exception handling to catch the `BitmapInvalidSizeException` if it occurs during the image-saving process.

```csharp
try
{
    // Attempt to save project as an image
    project.Save(DataDir + "SaveToStreamAndCatchException_out.mpp", options);
}
catch (BitmapInvalidSizeException ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, handling the `BitmapInvalidSizeException` when saving projects as images in Aspose.Tasks for .NET is crucial for ensuring smooth execution of your applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively catch and handle this exception, thus enhancing the robustness of your project management solutions.
