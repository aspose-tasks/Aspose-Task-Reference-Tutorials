## Introduction

Handling memory exceptions is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning of any software application. When working with Aspose.Tasks for .NET, developers often encounter memory-related issues, particularly when dealing with large projects or complex layouts. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to effectively handle memory exceptions using Aspose.Tasks Layout Builder.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic knowledge of C# programming: This tutorial assumes familiarity with C# syntax and concepts.
2. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Have an IDE such as Visual Studio installed for coding and compilation.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;

```

Let's break down the example code provided into multiple steps to understand how to handle memory exceptions with Aspose.Tasks Layout Builder effectively:

## Step 1: Load the Project

```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Blank2010.mpp");
```

This step loads the project file "Blank2010.mpp" into an instance of the `Project` class.

## Step 2: Customize Gantt Chart View

```csharp
var ganttChart = (GanttChartView)project.Views.ToList()[0];
ganttChart.MiddleTimescaleTier.Unit = TimescaleUnit.Hours;
ganttChart.BottomTimescaleTier.Unit = TimescaleUnit.Minutes;
ganttChart.BottomTimescaleTier.Count = 1;
```

Here, we customize the Gantt Chart view by adjusting the timescale units and count for better visualization.

## Step 3: Configure Image Save Options

```csharp
var options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.Png);
options.Timescale = Timescale.DefinedInView;
```

In this step, we create an instance of `ImageSaveOptions` to specify the format of the output image and timescale settings.

## Step 4: Save the Project as an Image

```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "SaveToStreamWithOptionsAndCatchException_out.mpp", options);
```

Finally, we save the project with specified options. This is where a memory exception may occur if the project is too large or complex.

## Step 5: Handle Exceptions

```csharp
catch (ApsLayoutBuilderOutOfMemoryException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (BitmapInvalidSizeException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

Here, we catch and handle specific exceptions related to memory and bitmap size, providing appropriate error messages or handling logic.

## Conclusion

By following this step-by-step guide, you can effectively handle memory exceptions when working with Aspose.Tasks Layout Builder in your .NET applications. Remember to optimize resource usage and consider the complexity of your projects to mitigate memory-related issues.
