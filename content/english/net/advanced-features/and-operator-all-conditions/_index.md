## Introduction

Are you looking to streamline your project management tasks efficiently? With Aspose.Tasks for .NET, you can leverage powerful functionalities to manipulate project data effectively. One such feature is the ability to use the AND operator in all conditions, allowing you to filter tasks based on multiple criteria simultaneously. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of implementing this functionality step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Have an IDE such as Visual Studio installed on your system for coding convenience.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods.

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

using Aspose.Tasks.Util;

```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps to understand the process clearly.

## Step 1: Load the Project File

```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```

Load the project file using the `Project` class constructor, specifying the file path.

## Step 2: Collect All Project Tasks

```csharp
var coll = new ChildTasksCollector();
TaskUtils.Apply(project.RootTask, coll, 0);
```

Utilize the `ChildTasksCollector` class to collect all tasks within the project.

## Step 3: Define Filter Conditions

```csharp
var conditions = new List<ICondition<Task>>
{
    new NotNullCondition(),
    new SummaryCondition()
};
```

Create a list of conditions to filter tasks. In this example, we filter tasks that are not null and are summary tasks.

## Step 4: Apply AND Operator to Conditions

```csharp
var joinedCondition = new AndAllCondition<Task>(conditions);
```

Join the conditions using the `AndAllCondition` class, applying the AND operator to all conditions.

## Step 5: Filter Tasks

```csharp
List<Task> collection = Filter(coll.Tasks, joinedCondition);
```

Apply the joined condition to the collected tasks to filter them accordingly.

## Step 6: Process Filtered Tasks

```csharp
foreach (var task in collection)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + task.Get(Tsk.Name));
    // Perform operations with filtered tasks
}
```

Iterate through the filtered tasks and perform operations as required.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, utilizing the AND operator in all conditions with Aspose.Tasks for .NET empowers you to efficiently filter project tasks based on multiple criteria simultaneously. By following the step-by-step guide provided in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your project management workflow, enhancing productivity and organization.
