## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to collect split parts in MS Project using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Splitting tasks into parts can be a crucial aspect of project management, and Aspose.Tasks provides convenient methods to handle this efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial as we'll be writing code snippets in C#.

## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, include the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using NUnit.Framework;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First, create a new project in your preferred IDE and ensure Aspose.Tasks for .NET is referenced correctly.
## Step 2: Initialize the Project Object
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Splits.mpp");
```
Initialize a new Project object with the path to your MS Project file.
## Step 3: Retrieve Task and Iterate Over Split Parts
```csharp
var task = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
// Iterate over split parts
Console.WriteLine("Iterate over split parts");
Console.WriteLine("Split parts count:" + task.SplitParts.Count);
foreach (var splitPart in task.SplitParts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Start: " + splitPart.Start);
    Console.WriteLine("Finish: " + splitPart.Finish);
}
```
Retrieve the task from the project and iterate over its split parts, printing out their start and finish dates.
## Step 4: Get Split Part by Index
```csharp
// Get the part by index
var split = task.SplitParts[0];
Console.WriteLine("Split start: " + split.Start);
```
Retrieve a specific split part by index and print out its start date.

## Conclusion
Managing split parts in MS Project files can significantly enhance project management efficiency. Aspose.Tasks for .NET simplifies this process by providing intuitive APIs to handle split tasks seamlessly.
