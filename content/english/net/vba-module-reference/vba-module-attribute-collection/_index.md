## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.Tasks for .NET! If you're a developer looking to harness the power of Aspose.Tasks for .NET in your projects, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of working with VBA Module Attributes, providing you with a step-by-step guide on how to effectively utilize them in your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from the [official download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Have a .NET-compatible IDE, such as Visual Studio, installed on your machine.
- Document Directory: Set up a document directory in your project to manage your files efficiently.
## Import Namespaces
To kickstart the process, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This step ensures that you have access to the functionalities provided by Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Here's a snippet to guide you:
```csharp
    using System;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for a seamless understanding of working with VBA Module Attributes using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Step 1: Set Document Directory
Before diving into the code, make sure to set the path to your document directory. This will be the location where you store your project files.
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Iterate Through Modules
In this step, iterate through the modules in your Aspose.Tasks project. This is essential for accessing VBA Module Attributes.
```csharp
foreach (var module in project.VbaProject.Modules)
{
    // Your code for module iteration goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Display Attributes Count
Retrieve and display the count of attributes for each module. This provides insights into the number of VBA Module Attributes associated with a particular module.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Attributes Count: " + module.Attributes.Count);
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Attributes
Now, iterate through the attributes of each module and print relevant information, such as VB Name and Module.
```csharp
foreach (var attribute in module.Attributes)
{
    Console.WriteLine("VB Name: " + attribute.Key);
    Console.WriteLine("Module: " + attribute.Value);
}
```
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the steps to work with VBA Module Attributes using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Feel free to integrate and customize this code according to your specific project requirements.
