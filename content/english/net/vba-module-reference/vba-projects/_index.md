## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Tasks library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Document Directory: Set up a directory where your project documents are stored.
Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.Tasks:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    
```
## Read Modules Information
## Step 1: Load Project
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "VbaProject.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Count Modules
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Total Modules Count: " + project.VbaProject.Modules.Count);
```
## Step 3: Iterate Through Modules
```csharp
foreach (var module in project.VbaProject.Modules)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Module Name: " + module.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("Source Code: " + module.SourceCode);
}
```
## Read VBA Project Information
## Step 1: Load Project (if not already loaded)
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "VbaProject.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Display Project Information
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("VbaProject.Name " + project.VbaProject.Name);
Console.WriteLine("VbaProject.Description " + project.VbaProject.Description);
Console.WriteLine("VbaProject.CompilationArguments" + project.VbaProject.CompilationArguments);
Console.WriteLine("VbaProject.HelpContextId" + project.VbaProject.HelpContextId);
Console.WriteLine("VbaProject.HelpFile" + project.VbaProject.HelpFile);
```
## Read References Information
## Step 1: Load Project (if not already loaded)
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "VbaProject.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Count and Display References
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Reference count " + project.VbaProject.References.Count);
foreach (var reference in project.VbaProject.References)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Identifier: " + reference.LibIdentifier);
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + reference.Name);
}
```
By following these steps, you can seamlessly work with VBA Projects in Aspose.Tasks, gaining valuable insights and enhancing your project management capabilities.
