## Introduction
Are you looking to effectively manage and monitor your MS Project usage with Aspose.Tasks? With the power of metering, you can keep track of your usage and optimize your project management efforts. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of metering MS Project usage step by step using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into metering MS Project usage, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/). Follow the installation instructions to set up the library in your development environment.
2. Public and Private Keys: Obtain your public and private keys from Aspose. These keys are essential for metering usage. If you don't have keys yet, you can request them from Aspose through the [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) page.

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding, import the necessary namespaces to your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using System.Net;
using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Metering
To begin metering MS Project usage, set up the metered environment by providing your public and private keys:
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("<public key>", "<private key>");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory, and substitute `<public key>` and `<private key>` with your actual keys obtained from Aspose.
## Step 2: Load MS Project File
Next, load your MS Project file using Aspose.Tasks:
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
Console.WriteLine("Project Name: " + project.Get(Prj.Name));
```
This step loads the MS Project file named "Project2.mpp" from the specified directory. You can replace the filename with your own MS Project file.
## Step 3: Work with Project
Now that the project is loaded, you can perform various operations on it as needed for your project management tasks.
```csharp
// Perform project management tasks here
```
## Step 4: Check Credits and Bytes Consumption
You can check the credits spent and bytes consumed during your usage period:
```csharp
try
{
    Console.WriteLine("Credits spent: {0}", Metered.GetConsumptionCredit());
    Console.WriteLine("Bytes consumed: {0}", Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity());
}
catch (WebException)
{
    // Handle exceptions here
}
```
This step retrieves and displays the credits spent and bytes consumed by your operations. Handle any exceptions that may occur during this process.
## Step 5: Reset Metered Key
Optionally, you can reset the metered key to stop counting bytes:
```csharp
metered.ResetMeteredKey();
```
This step stops the metering process and resets the metered key.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to meter MS Project usage using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and optimize your project management efforts while ensuring efficient resource utilization.
