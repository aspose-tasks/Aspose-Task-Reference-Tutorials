## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of saving CSS arguments using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are crucial for defining the presentation of HTML elements. Aspose.Tasks allows us to manipulate and save these CSS attributes efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Installation: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

2. Basic Knowledge: Familiarity with C# and .NET development environment is recommended.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;

```
## Step 1: Define CSS Saving Callbacks

Firstly, we define the CSS saving callback methods to handle the saving of CSS files:

```csharp
private class ResourcePrefixForNestedResources : ICssSavingCallback
{
    public void CssSaving(CssSavingArgs args)
    {
        // Implement your CSS saving logic here
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Implement Font and Image Saving Callbacks

Next, implement the font and image saving callback methods similarly:

```csharp
public void FontSaving(FontSavingArgs args)
{
    // Implement your font saving logic here
}

public void ImageSaving(ImageSavingArgs args)
{
    // Implement your image saving logic here
}
```

## Step 3: Configure Save Options

Now, configure the HTML save options to utilize the implemented callbacks:

```csharp
public static HtmlSaveOptions GetSaveOptions(int pageNumber)
{
    var options = new HtmlSaveOptions
    {
        // Configure HTML saving options
    };

    var program = new ResourcePrefixForNestedResources();
    options.FontSavingCallback = program;
    options.CssSavingCallback = program;
    options.ImageSavingCallback = program;

    return options;
}
```

## Step 4: Save Project with Customized CSS

Finally, save your project with the customized CSS settings:

```csharp
var project = new Project("Project1.mpp");
var options = ResourcePrefixForNestedResources.GetSaveOptions(1);
project.Save("document_out.html", options);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to save CSS arguments using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By defining CSS saving callbacks and configuring HTML save options, we can efficiently manipulate CSS attributes according to our requirements.
