## Introduction

Handling durations effectively is crucial in project management applications. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides robust functionality for managing durations efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll explore various aspects of duration handling using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to understand and implement the examples.
2. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE to create and run .NET applications.
3. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.Tasks functionalities:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;


```

Let's break down each example into multiple steps in a step-by-step guide format:

## Updating Durations of Tasks

### Step 1: Load Project File

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskDurations.mpp");
```

### Step 2: Get Task and Duration

```csharp
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
var duration1 = task1.Get(Tsk.Duration);
```

### Step 3: Update Duration

```csharp
duration1 = duration1.Add(project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day));
task1.Set(Tsk.Duration, duration1);
```

### Step 4: Display Updated Duration

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("The duration of task 1: " + task1.Get(Tsk.Duration));
```

## Subtracting Durations of Tasks

### Step 1: Load Project File

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskDurations.mpp");
```

### Step 2: Get Task and Duration

```csharp
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
var duration1 = task1.Get(Tsk.Duration);
```

### Step 3: Subtract Duration

```csharp
duration1 = duration1.Subtract(project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day));
task1.Set(Tsk.Duration, duration1);
```

### Step 4: Display Updated Duration

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("The duration of task 1: " + task1.Get(Tsk.Duration));
```

## Converting Duration to TimeSpan

### Step 1: Load Project File

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskDurations.mpp");
```

### Step 2: Get Task and Duration

```csharp
var task = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
var duration = task.Get(Tsk.Duration);
```

### Step 3: Convert Duration to TimeSpan

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Time span of duration: " + duration.TimeSpan);
```

## Converting Duration to String

### Step 1: Load Project File

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskDurations.mpp");
```

### Step 2: Get Task and Duration

```csharp
var task = project.RootTask.Children.GetById(1);
var duration = task.Get(Tsk.Duration);
```

### Step 3: Convert Duration to String

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("The duration as a string: " + duration.ToString());
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered various aspects of duration handling in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Understanding and effectively managing durations is vital for successful project management. Aspose.Tasks provides comprehensive functionalities to simplify duration management tasks in your .NET applications.
