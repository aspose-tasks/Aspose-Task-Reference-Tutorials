## Introduction

In the realm of project management, Aspose.Tasks for .NET stands out as a robust solution for handling tasks and projects efficiently. This powerful library provides developers with the tools they need to manage tasks, projects, and everything in between seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific aspect of Aspose.Tasks: collecting child tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential.
2. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Development Environment: Set up a development environment, such as Visual Studio, to write and execute C# code.
4. Access to Documentation: Keep the [Aspose.Tasks for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/net/) handy for reference.

Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let's dive into the step-by-step guide to collecting child tasks using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, import the necessary namespaces into your C# code to access the functionality provided by Aspose.Tasks for .NET.

```csharp
using System;

using Aspose.Tasks.Util;

```

Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps to understand the process thoroughly.

## Step 1: Initialize Project Object

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "ParentChildTasks.mpp");
```

This line of code initializes a new `Project` object, loading a project file named "ParentChildTasks.mpp" from the specified directory.

## Step 2: Create ChildTasksCollector Object

```csharp
var collector = new ChildTasksCollector();
```

Here, we create a new `ChildTasksCollector` object, which will help us collect child tasks from the project.

## Step 3: Apply Collector to Root Task

```csharp
TaskUtils.Apply(project.RootTask, collector, 0);
```

We apply the `ChildTasksCollector` to the root task of the project, initiating the collection process recursively.

## Step 4: Iterate Through Collected Tasks

```csharp
foreach (var task in collector.Tasks)
{
    Console.WriteLine(task.Get(Tsk.Name));
}
```

Finally, we iterate through the collected tasks and print their names to the console.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to collect child tasks using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently manage and manipulate tasks within your projects, enhancing productivity and organization.
