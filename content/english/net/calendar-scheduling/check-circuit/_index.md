Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a powerful library that provides developers with the tools they need to streamline project management processes. Whether you're creating, reading, or manipulating Microsoft Project files, Aspose.Tasks simplifies the task with its intuitive APIs and comprehensive features.

## Prerequisites

```

## Step 1: Load the Project File

Begin by loading the Microsoft Project file (.mpp) that you want to check for a broken structure. Use the `Project` class to load the file.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "ParentChildTasks.mpp");

## Step 2: Check the Project Structure

To detect any broken structure within the project, we'll use the `CheckCircuit` class along with the `TaskUtils.Apply` method.

```csharp
try
{
    TaskUtils.Apply(project.RootTask, new CheckCircuit(), 0);
}
catch (TasksException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex);
}
```
