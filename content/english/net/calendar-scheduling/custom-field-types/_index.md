## Introduction

Welcome to our tutorial on working with custom field types in Aspose.Tasks for .NET! Aspose.Tasks is a powerful library that allows developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll focus on understanding and utilizing custom field types, a crucial aspect of working with project data.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. Visual Studio Installed

Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your system. You can download it from the Microsoft website.

### 2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET

You need to have Aspose.Tasks for .NET library installed in your Visual Studio project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

### 3. Basic C# Knowledge

Familiarity with C# programming language is necessary to follow along with this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into our project. This step is essential to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Tasks library.

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
```

Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps and understand each step in detail.

## Step 1: Create Project Object

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```

This line creates a new instance of the `Project` class and loads the project file "Project2.mpp" from the specified directory.

## Step 2: Define Custom Field

```csharp
var definition = ExtendedAttributeDefinition.CreateTaskDefinition(
    CustomFieldType.Text,
    ExtendedAttributeTask.Text1,
    "MyText");
```

Here, we define a custom field of type `Text` for tasks. We specify `ExtendedAttributeTask.Text1` to indicate the field location and provide a name for the custom field, which is "MyText" in this case.

## Step 3: Add Custom Field Definition to Project

```csharp
project.ExtendedAttributes.Add(definition);
```

Finally, we add the custom field definition to the project's extended attributes collection.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to work with custom field types in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Understanding and utilizing custom fields is essential for efficiently managing project data and customizing project files according to specific requirements.
