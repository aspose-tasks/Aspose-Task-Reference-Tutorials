## Import Namespaces

In order to utilize Aspose.Tasks functionalities, import the necessary namespaces into your C# code. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Your C# Project

Open your existing C# project or create a new one in your preferred IDE.

### Step 2: Add Aspose.Tasks Reference

Add a reference to the Aspose.Tasks library in your project. You can achieve this by either installing the library via NuGet Package Manager or manually referencing the DLL.

### Step 3: Import Namespaces

Import the required namespaces at the beginning of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using NUnit.Framework;

```

The `CompoundDocumentHeaderException` is thrown when a file being loaded is not a valid Microsoft Project file. Below are the steps to effectively handle this exception using Aspose.Tasks:

## Step 1: Try-Catch Block

Enclose the code that may potentially throw the `CompoundDocumentHeaderException` within a try-catch block.

```csharp
try
{
    // Load the project file
    var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project1.mpp");

    // Display project name
    Console.WriteLine("Project Name: " + project.Get(Prj.Name));
}
catch (CompoundDocumentHeaderException e)
{
    // Catch and handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Step 2: Load Project File

Load the project file using the `Project` class provided by Aspose.Tasks.

## Step 3: Display Project Information

Access any required project information, such as the project name, using appropriate methods or properties.

## Step 4: Exception Handling

In case the `CompoundDocumentHeaderException` occurs during project loading, handle it within the catch block. Print or log the exception message for further analysis.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, handling exceptions like `CompoundDocumentHeaderException` is crucial for robust .NET application development. With Aspose.Tasks for .NET, developers can effectively manage such exceptions and ensure smooth execution of project management tasks.
