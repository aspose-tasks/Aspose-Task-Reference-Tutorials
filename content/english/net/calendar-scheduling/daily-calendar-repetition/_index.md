## Introduction

Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a powerful set of tools for managing tasks and projects programmatically. One of its notable features is the ability to handle daily calendar repetitions efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize the `DailyCalendarRepetition` class along with other relevant classes to create recurring tasks with daily repetitions based on a specified calendar.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1. Installation: Make sure you have Aspose.Tasks for .NET installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

2. Namespace Importing: Import the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;

```

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

Firstly, we need to load an existing project or create a new one to work with:

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project1.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Define the Calendar

Next, we create a calendar with a 24-hour duration and associate it with the project:

```csharp
var calendar = project.Calendars.Add("24 Hours");
Calendar.Make24HourCalendar(calendar);
```

## Step 3: Set Recurring Task Parameters

Now, let's set the parameters for our recurring task. We define its name, duration, recurrence pattern, and range:

```csharp
var parameters = new RecurringTaskParameters
{
    TaskName = "t1",
    Duration = project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day),
    RecurrencePattern = new DailyRecurrencePattern
    {
        Repetition = new DailyCalendarRepetition { RepetitionInterval = 1 },
        RecurrenceRange = new EndByRecurrenceRange
        {
            Start = new DateTime(2018, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0),
            Finish = new DateTime(2018, 7, 8, 16, 0, 0)
        }
    }
};
```

## Step 4: Set Calendar for Task

Associate the defined calendar with the task:

```csharp
parameters.SetCalendar(project, "24 Hours");
```

## Step 5: Add Task to Project

Add the task with defined parameters to the project:

```csharp
project.RootTask.Children.Add(parameters);
```

## Step 6: Save the Project

Finally, save the project with the added recurring task:

```csharp
project.Save(OutDir + "CanAddRecurringTask_Days_CalendarDays_24h_Test_out.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```

Now you've successfully created a project with a recurring task set to repeat daily based on a 24-hour calendar using Aspose.Tasks for .NET!
