## Introduction
If you're a .NET developer diving into project management using Aspose.Tasks, you've come to the right place! In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore the intricacies of handling text item types in Aspose.Tasks, focusing on customization using the powerful .NET library.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Tasks library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Document Directory: Set up a directory for your project documents.
Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty of handling text item types.
## Import Namespaces
First things first, import the necessary namespaces to kickstart your project:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Drawing;
    
    using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
    using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```
## Step 1: Set Document Directory
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your project documents.
## Step 2: Load Project and Customize
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "CreateProject2.mpp");
```
Load your project file (in this case, "CreateProject2.mpp") using the Aspose.Tasks library.
## Step 3: Save Options and Presentation Format
```csharp
SaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    PresentationFormat = PresentationFormat.ResourceSheet
};
```
Define save options, and set the presentation format to Resource Sheet for customization.
## Step 4: Customize Text Style
```csharp
var style = new TextStyle(FontStyles.Italic | FontStyles.Bold)
{
    Color = Color.OrangeRed
};
style.ItemType = TextItemType.OverallocatedResources;
```
Create a text style with desired font styles, color, and set the item type to Overallocated Resources.
## Step 5: Apply Text Styles and Save
```csharp
options.TextStyles = new List<TextStyle>
{
    style
};
project.Save(DataDir + "CustomizeTextStyle_out.pdf", options);
```
Apply the defined text style to your project and save the customized project as a PDF file.
Repeat these steps for other customization needs, experimenting with different text item types, font styles, and colors.
