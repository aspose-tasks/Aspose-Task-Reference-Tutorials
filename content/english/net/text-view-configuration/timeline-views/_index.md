## Introduction
Creating visually appealing and informative timeline views is crucial for effective project management. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a robust solution for customizing timeline views, allowing you to tailor the display of tasks according to your project's specific needs. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to use Aspose.Tasks to create and customize timeline views effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET library installed. If not, download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
## Import Namespaces
Ensure you import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
    using System;
    
    using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
```
## Step 1: Initialize a Project and Timeline View
Start by initializing a new project and a timeline view:
```csharp
var project = new Project();
var view = new TimelineView();
```
## Step 2: Set Timeline View Properties
Customize the timeline view by setting various properties:
```csharp
view.DateFormat = DateFormat.DateDddDd;
view.DisplayOverlapped = true;
view.ShowPanZoom = true;
view.ShowTimescale = true;
view.ShowToday = true;
view.TextLinesCount = 2;
```
## Step 3: Display Timeline View Details
Retrieve information about the timeline view:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Show Dates: " + view.ShowDates);
```
## Step 4: Add View to Project
Add the customized timeline view to the project:
```csharp
project.Views.Add(view);
```
## Step 5: Add Test Data to Project
Populate the project with sample tasks:
```csharp
var task1 = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 1");
task1.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 29, 8, 0, 0));
task1.Set(Tsk.Duration, task1.ParentProject.GetDuration(24, TimeUnitType.Hour));
var task2 = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 2");
task2.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 29, 8, 0, 0));
task2.Set(Tsk.Duration, task1.ParentProject.GetDuration(40, TimeUnitType.Hour));
```
## Step 6: Save the Project as PDF
Save the project with the customized timeline view as a PDF file:
```csharp
project.Save("Your Document Directory/SetTimeScaleCount_out.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
