## Introduction
If you're a .NET developer looking to enhance your project management capabilities, Aspose.Tasks is a powerful tool that allows you to manipulate Microsoft Project files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on configuring usage views using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Follow along to gain insights into rendering task usage views with details for better project visualization.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Tasks Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.Tasks library integrated into your .NET project. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/) and follow the installation instructions.
- Document Directory: Set up a directory where your project documents are stored. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the code snippets with the actual path to your document directory.
## Import Namespaces
In the code snippet provided, you'll notice the usage of certain namespaces. Make sure to include these in your project for seamless integration:
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
```
## Step 1: Render Task Usage View with Details
Let's start by rendering a task usage view with details. Follow these steps:
## Step 1.1: Load Project
```csharp
// The path to th documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "TaskUsageViewWithDetails.mpp");
```
## Step 1.2: Get the View
```csharp
UsageView view = (TaskUsageView)project.DefaultView;
```
## Step 1.3: Customize View Settings
```csharp
view.DisplayDetailsHeaderColumn = false;
view.RepeatDetailsHeaderOnAllRows = false;
view.DisplayShortDetailHeaderNames = false;
view.AlignDetailsData = HorizontalStringAlignment.Near;
```
## Step 1.4: Save Project as PDF
```csharp
project.Save(OutDir + "task_usage1_out.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
## Step 2: Display Details Header Column
In this step, we'll modify the view settings to display the details header column and save the project as PDF:
## Step 2.1: Display Details Header Column
```csharp
view.DisplayDetailsHeaderColumn = true;
```
## Step 2.2: Repeat Details Header on All Rows
```csharp
view.RepeatDetailsHeaderOnAllRows = true;
view.AlignDetailsData = HorizontalStringAlignment.Far;
```
## Step 2.3: Save Project as PDF
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "task_usage2_out.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully configured usage views in Aspose.Tasks. This tutorial provides a foundation for efficient project management and visualization using the Aspose.Tasks library.
