## Introduction
Gantt charts are powerful tools used in project management to visualize tasks, timelines, and dependencies. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides robust capabilities for working with Gantt chart views in Microsoft Project files. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize Aspose.Tasks to manipulate Gantt chart views, customize their appearance, and save them as PDF files.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET
Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. You can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
### 2. Microsoft Project File
Prepare a Microsoft Project file (`Project2.mpp`) that you will use to work with Gantt chart views.
### 3. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET Framework
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming language and .NET framework.
## Import Namespaces
Before you begin working with Gantt chart views in Aspose.Tasks, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# code. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Linq;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System.Drawing;
```

Let's break down the provided example code into multiple steps and explain each step in detail:
## Step 1: Load the Project File
```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```
This step involves loading the Microsoft Project file (`Project2.mpp`) into an instance of the `Project` class.
## Step 2: Set Status Date
```csharp
project.Set(Prj.StatusDate, project.Get(Prj.StartDate));
```
Here, we set the status date of the project to its start date.
## Step 3: Access Gantt Chart View
```csharp
var view = (GanttChartView)project.Views.ToList()[0];
```
We access the Gantt chart view from the project. Aspose.Tasks allows accessing views like Gantt Chart, Network Diagram, and Task Usage.
## Step 4: Customize Gantt Chart View
Now, let's customize various aspects of the Gantt chart view:
### Set Bar Rounding
```csharp
view.BarRounding = false;
```
This sets whether the bars on the Gantt chart will round to the nearest day.
### Set Bar Size
```csharp
view.BarSize = GanttBarSize.BarSize24;
```
This determines the height of the Gantt bars in the chart.
### Hide Rollup Bars
```csharp
view.HideRollupBarsWhenSummaryExpanded = true;
```
Specifies whether rollup bars will be hidden when expanding summary tasks.
### Set Non-Working Time Color
```csharp
view.NonWorkingTimeColor = Color.Azure;
```
Defines the color for non-working time on the Gantt chart.
### Roll Up Gantt Bars
```csharp
view.RollUpGanttBars = true;
```
Specifies whether bars on the Gantt chart must be rolled up.
### Show Bar Splits
```csharp
view.ShowBarSplits = true;
```
Determines whether task splits on the Gantt chart must be shown.
### Show Drawings
```csharp
view.ShowDrawings = true;
```
Specifies whether drawings on the Gantt chart must be shown.
### Timescale Size Percentage
```csharp
view.TimescaleSizePercentage = 10;
```
Sets a percentage to adjust the spacing between units on the timescale tier.
## Step 5: Save Gantt Chart View as PDF
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "WorkWithGanttChartViews_out.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
Finally, we save the customized Gantt chart view as a PDF file.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to work with Gantt chart views in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following the provided steps, you can efficiently manipulate and customize Gantt charts according to your project requirements.
