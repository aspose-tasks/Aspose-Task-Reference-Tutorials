## Introduction
Managing tasks in Microsoft Project can sometimes be challenging, especially when it comes to organizing them efficiently. Aspose.Tasks for .NET offers a comprehensive solution to this by providing functionalities to group tasks effectively. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to group MS Project tasks using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET development environment set up.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your C# project to use Aspose.Tasks functionalities:
```csharp
    using Aspose.Tasks;
    using System;
    
```
## Step 1: Load MS Project File
Begin by loading your MS Project file using the following code:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "YourProjectFile.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Access Task Groups
Next, let's access the task groups within the project:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Task Groups Count: " + project.TaskGroups.Count);
var group = project.TaskGroups.ToList()[1];
```
## Step 3: Retrieve Group Information
Now, retrieve information about the task group:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Task Group Uid: " + group.Uid);
Console.WriteLine("Task Group Index: " + group.Index);
Console.WriteLine("Task Group Name: " + group.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Is Task Group Maintain Hierarchy?: " + group.MaintainHierarchy);
Console.WriteLine("Is Task Group Show In Menu?: " + group.ShowInMenu);
Console.WriteLine("Is Task Group Show Summary?: " + group.ShowSummary);
```
## Step 4: Access Group Criteria
Access the criteria set for the task group:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Task Group Criteria count: " + group.GroupCriteria.Count);
```
## Step 5: Retrieve Criterion Information
Retrieve detailed information about each criterion:
```csharp
foreach (var criterion in group.GroupCriteria)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Task Criterion Field: " + criterion.Field);
    Console.WriteLine("Task Criterion GroupOn: " + criterion.GroupOn);
    Console.WriteLine("Task Criterion Cell Color: " + criterion.CellColor);
    Console.WriteLine("Task Criterion Pattern: " + criterion.Pattern);
    if (group == criterion.ParentGroup)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Parent Group is equal to task Group.");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Font Name: " + criterion.Font.FontFamily);
    Console.WriteLine("Font Size: " + criterion.Font.Size);
    Console.WriteLine("Font Style: " + criterion.Font.Style);
    Console.WriteLine("Ascending/Descending: " + criterion.Ascending);
}
```
By following these steps, you can effectively group MS Project tasks using Aspose.Tasks for .NET, enhancing the organization and management of your project data.
