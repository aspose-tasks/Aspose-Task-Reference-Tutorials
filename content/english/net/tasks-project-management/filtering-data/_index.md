## Introduction
Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides robust functionality for filtering data in Microsoft Project files, allowing users to efficiently manage and analyze project information. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to filter data using Aspose.Tasks in a step-by-step guide format.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install Aspose.Tasks for .NET
Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library in your development environment.
### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have a working development environment for .NET programming. This includes a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio and a basic understanding of C# programming language.
### 3. Access Sample Microsoft Project File
Prepare a sample Microsoft Project file (.mpp) that contains the data you want to filter. Ensure you have the file accessible in your project directory.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code file, import the necessary namespaces to utilize Aspose.Tasks functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using NUnit.Framework;
```
Now let's break down the process of filtering data in MS Project using Aspose.Tasks into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Load Project File
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(dataDir + "SampleProject.mpp");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your project file directory.
## Step 2: Retrieve Task Filters
```csharp
List<Filter> filters = project.TaskFilters.ToList();
```
Retrieve a list of task filters present in the project.
## Step 3: Display Task Filter Details
```csharp
foreach (var filter in filters)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Uid: " + filter.Uid);
    Console.WriteLine("Index: " + filter.Index);
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + filter.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("Type: " + filter.FilterType);
    Console.WriteLine("Show In Menu: " + filter.ShowInMenu);
    Console.WriteLine("Show Related Summary Rows: " + filter.ShowRelatedSummaryRows);
}
```
Iterate through the list of task filters and display their details such as Uid, Index, Name, Filter Type, Show In Menu, and Show Related Summary Rows.
## Step 4: Check Resource Filters
```csharp
List<Filter> resourceFilters = project.ResourceFilters.ToList();
```
Retrieve a list of resource filters present in the project.
## Step 5: Display Resource Filter Details
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Project.ResourceFilters count: " + resourceFilters.Count);
Console.WriteLine("Resource Filter Item Type: Item.ResourceType: " + resourceFilters[0].FilterType);
Console.WriteLine("Resource filter ShowInMenu" + resourceFilters[0].ShowInMenu);
Console.WriteLine("Resource filter ShowRelatedSummaryRows: " + resourceFilters[0].ShowRelatedSummaryRows);
```
Display details of resource filters including count, filter type, Show In Menu, and Show Related Summary Rows.
## Conclusion
Filtering data in MS Project files using Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a straightforward process that enhances productivity and analysis capabilities. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently manage project information according to specific criteria.
