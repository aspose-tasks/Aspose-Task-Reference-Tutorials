## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a page saving callback in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. This feature allows us to save a multi-page document to user-provided streams, offering flexibility and customization in handling output.

## Prerequisites:

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Knowledge of C# programming language: You should have a basic understanding of C# syntax and concepts.
   
2. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed the Aspose.Tasks library in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).

3. Development Environment Setup: Set up your preferred IDE for .NET development, such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces:

To start, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;

```

## Step 1: Create a Project Object

Instantiate a `Project` object by loading an existing project file:

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Homemoveplan.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Configure Image Save Options

Define `ImageSaveOptions` and customize page saving behavior by setting the `PageSavingCallback` property:

```csharp
var imageSaveOptions = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.Png);
var callback = new CustomPageSavingCallback();
imageSaveOptions.PageSavingCallback = callback;
imageSaveOptions.RenderToSinglePage = false;
```

## Step 3: Save Project with Callback

Save the project using the configured image save options:

```csharp
project.Save(Stream.Null, imageSaveOptions);
```

## Step 4: Process Saved Page Streams

Iterate through the page streams provided by the callback to process each page individually:

```csharp
foreach (var stream in callback.PageStreams)
{
    // Process each page stream
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Custom Page Saving Callback

Create a class that implements the `IPageSavingCallback` interface to handle page saving:

```csharp
private sealed class CustomPageSavingCallback : IPageSavingCallback
{
    public List<MemoryStream> PageStreams { get; } = new List<MemoryStream>();

    public void PageSaving(PageSavingArgs args)
    {
        var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
        args.Stream = memoryStream;
        args.KeepStreamOpen = false;
        PageStreams.Add(memoryStream);
    }

    public void OnFinish()
    {
        // Perform any cleanup or finalization
    }
}
```

## Conclusion:

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement a page saving callback in Aspose.Tasks for .NET, allowing us to save multi-page documents to separate streams. By following these steps, you can enhance your application's functionality and achieve customized output handling.
