## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of handling image saving in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful API that enables developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically. One common task when working with project files is the need to save images, which can include charts, graphs, or other visual elements. We'll break down the process step by step, ensuring clarity and understanding throughout.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics.

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;
using Saving;
using Visualization;
```

## Step 1: Create a Project Object

Start by creating a Project object from your Microsoft Project file:

```csharp
var project = new Project("Project1.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Define Save Options

Define the save options for your project, specifying the pages and other settings:

```csharp
var options = GetSaveOptions(1);
```

## Step 3: Save the Project as HTML

Save the project as HTML with the specified options:

```csharp
project.Save("document_out.html", options);
```

## Step 4: Implement Image Saving Callback

Implement the ImageSavingCallback interface to handle image saving:

```csharp
private class ResourcePrefixForNestedResources : IImageSavingCallback
{
    public void ImageSaving(ImageSavingArgs args)
    {
        // Image saving logic goes here
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Save Images to Specified Directory

Within the ImageSaving method, specify the logic to save images to the desired directory:

```csharp
if (args.FileName.EndsWith("png"))
{
    // Save nested resources
}
else
{
    // Save regular resources
}
```

## Step 6: Specify Save Options

Specify the save options, including callbacks for CSS, fonts, and images:

```csharp
public static HtmlSaveOptions GetSaveOptions(int pageNumber)
{
    var options = new HtmlSaveOptions
    {
        // Specify save options here
    };

    var program = new ResourcePrefixForNestedResources();
    options.FontSavingCallback = program;
    options.CssSavingCallback = program;
    options.ImageSavingCallback = program;

    return options;
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, handling image saving in Aspose.Tasks for .NET involves defining save options and implementing callbacks to manage the saving process effectively. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate image saving functionality into your .NET applications.
