## Introduction

If you're working with Microsoft Project databases in your .NET applications using Aspose.Tasks, you'll need to configure the necessary settings to import project data seamlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Tasks library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Access to a Microsoft Project Database: You should have access to a Microsoft Project database to import data from.

## Import Namespaces

First, make sure you import the necessary namespaces to your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Aspose.Tasks.Connectivity;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Create Connection String

Construct the connection string to your Microsoft Project database. Here's an example:

```csharp
var connectionString = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder();
connectionString.DataSource = "192.168.56.2,1433";
connectionString.Encrypt = true;
connectionString.TrustServerCertificate = true;
connectionString.InitialCatalog = "ProjectServer_Published";
connectionString.NetworkLibrary = "DBMSSOCN";
connectionString.UserID = "sa";
connectionString.Password = "*";
connectionString.ConnectTimeout = 2;
```

Ensure to replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.

## Step 2: Configure MspDbSettings

Create an instance of `MspDbSettings` and specify the connection string along with the project GUID:

```csharp
var settings = new MspDbSettings(connectionString.ConnectionString, new Guid("E6426C44-D6CB-4B9C-AF16-48910ACE0F54"));
settings.Schema = "dbo";
```

## Step 3: Load Project Data

Instantiate a `Project` object using the configured settings:

```csharp
var project = new Project(settings);
```

## Step 4: Save Project Data

Save the loaded project data to a file:

```csharp
project.Save(OutDir + "ImportProjectDataFromDatabase_out.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to configure settings for accessing Microsoft Project databases using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can seamlessly import project data into your applications, facilitating efficient project management.
