## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the management of OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. OLE objects enable users to embed or link files from other applications within a project file. We'll cover how to work with a collection of these objects step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Tasks for .NET from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language fundamentals.

## Import Namespaces

To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;

```

## Step 1: Load the Project File

Firstly, load the project file containing the OLE objects:

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Embedded.mpp");
```

## Step 2: Define File Extensions

Next, define the file extensions associated with the OLE objects:

```csharp
IDictionary<string, string> extensions = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    { "RTF", "_rtfFile_out.rtf" },
    { "MSWordDoc", "_wordFile_out.docx" },
    { "ExcelML12", "_excelFile_out.xlsx" }
};
```

## Step 3: Iterate Over OLE Objects

Now, iterate over the OLE objects within the project:

```csharp
foreach (var oleObject in project.OleObjects)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(oleObject.FileFormat) || !extensions.ContainsKey(oleObject.FileFormat))
    {
        continue;
    }

    var path = OutDir + "EmbeddedContent_" + extensions[oleObject.FileFormat];
    using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
    {
        stream.Write(oleObject.Content, 0, oleObject.Content.Length);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, managing OLE objects in Aspose.Tasks for .NET is crucial for handling embedded or linked files within project documents. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively work with OLE object collections in your .NET applications.
