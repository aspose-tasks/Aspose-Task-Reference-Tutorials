## Introduction
Microsoft Project is a powerful tool for managing projects, and Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides comprehensive support for manipulating project files programmatically. One essential aspect of project management is organizing tasks using outline codes. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to handle MS Project outline code definitions using Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
### 1. Installation of Aspose.Tasks for .NET
Ensure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
### 2. Basic Understanding of C# and .NET Framework
Familiarize yourself with C# programming language and the .NET framework as this tutorial requires intermediate-level C# knowledge.
### 3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Have an IDE such as Visual Studio installed on your system for coding and debugging.
## Import Namespaces
Before we start coding, let's import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Tasks for .NET.
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System;

using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
```
Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for a clear understanding.
## Step 1: Load the Project File
First, we need to load the MS Project file into our application.
```csharp
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "OutlineValues2010.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Create Outline Code Definition
Now, let's create a new outline code definition.
```csharp
var outline = new OutlineCodeDefinition();
```
## Step 3: Set Field Number and Name
Set the field number and name for the outline code.
```csharp
outline.FieldId = ExtendedAttributeTask.OutlineCode7.ToString("D");
outline.FieldName = "Outline Code1";
```
## Step 4: Set GUID and Other Properties
Set the GUID and other properties of the outline code.
```csharp
outline.Guid = "e6afac06-0d86-4359-a96c-db705e3d2ca8";
outline.LeafOnly = false;
outline.Alias = "My Outline Code";
outline.PhoneticAlias = "Outline Code";
outline.AllLevelsRequired = true;
outline.Enterprise = false;
outline.EnterpriseOutlineCodeAlias = 0;
```
## Step 5: Add Outline Mask
Add an outline mask to the outline code.
```csharp
var mask = new OutlineMask();
mask.Type = MaskType.Characters;
outline.Masks.Add(mask);
```
## Step 6: Set Other Properties
Set additional properties of the outline code.
```csharp
outline.OnlyTableValuesAllowed = false;
outline.ResourceSubstitutionEnabled = false;
outline.ShowIndent = false;
```
## Step 7: Add Outline Value
Finally, let's add an outline value to the outline code.
```csharp
var value = new OutlineValue();
value.Value = "Text value 1";
value.ValueId = 1;
value.Type = OutlineValueType.Text;
value.Description = "Text value descr 1";
outline.Values.Add(value);
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to handle MS Project outline code definitions using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can efficiently manipulate outline codes in your project files programmatically.
