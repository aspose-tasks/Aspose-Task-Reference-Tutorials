## Introduction
In the realm of project management and task tracking, Microsoft Project stands as a cornerstone tool. However, when it comes to manipulating and managing project files programmatically, Aspose.Tasks for .NET emerges as a powerful solution. This tutorial will delve into one specific aspect of working with MS Project files using Aspose.Tasks for .NET: handling outline masks.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Installed Visual Studio with .NET framework.
- Familiarity with Microsoft Project file formats.
- Downloaded and installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. If not, you can get it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- Basic understanding of project management concepts.
## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with the tutorial, import the necessary namespaces in your C# file:
```csharp
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Load Project File
The first step is to load the Microsoft Project file using Aspose.Tasks library.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "OutlineValues2010.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Define Outline Code
Next, define the outline code definition for the project.
```csharp
var outline = new OutlineCodeDefinition();
outline.FieldId = ExtendedAttributeTask.OutlineCode7.ToString("D");
outline.Alias = "My Outline Code";
project.OutlineCodes.Add(outline);
```
## Step 3: Define Outline Mask
Now, create an outline mask for the outline code.
```csharp
var mask = new OutlineMask();
// Set the type of the mask
mask.Type = MaskType.Characters;
// Set the separator of code values
mask.Separator = "/";
// Set the level of the mask
mask.Level = 1;
// Set the maximum length (in characters) of the outline code values. 0 if length is not defined.
mask.Length = 2;
// Add the mask to the definition
outline.Masks.Add(mask);
```
## Step 4: Define Outline Value
Define the outline value for the outline code.
```csharp
var value = new OutlineValue();
value.Value = "Text value 1";
value.ValueId = 1;
value.Type = OutlineValueType.Text;
value.Description = "Text value descr 1";
outline.Values.Add(value);
```
This step-by-step guide covers the process of working with outline masks in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can effectively manage outline masks in your Microsoft Project files programmatically.

## Conclusion
Mastering the manipulation of Microsoft Project files programmatically opens up a world of possibilities in project management automation. With Aspose.Tasks for .NET, handling outline masks becomes streamlined and efficient, empowering developers to create tailored solutions for project tracking and management.
