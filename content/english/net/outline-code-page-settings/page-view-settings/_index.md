## Introduction
Microsoft Project is a powerful tool for project management, but sometimes you need to customize the way your project is viewed and printed. With Aspose.Tasks for .NET, you can easily configure the page view settings to meet your specific requirements. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Ensure you have downloaded and installed the Aspose.Tasks for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Microsoft Project File: Have a Microsoft Project file ready that you want to configure the page view settings for.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Tasks in your .NET project.
```csharp
    using NUnit.Framework;
    using Saving;
```
## Step 1: Load the Project File
Start by loading your Microsoft Project file into an instance of the `Project` class.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Input.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Set First Columns Count
Specify the number of first columns to be printed on all pages.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.FirstColumnsCount = 2;
```
## Step 3: Print Notes
Choose whether to print notes along with the project.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.PrintNotes = true;
```
## Step 4: Fit Timescale to End of Page
Decide whether to fit the timescale to the end of a page when printing.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.FitTimescaleToEndOfPage = true;
```
## Step 5: Print All Sheet Columns
Specify whether to print all sheet columns of a view.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.PrintAllSheetColumns = true;
```
## Step 6: Print Blank Pages
Choose whether to print blank pages of a view.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.PrintBlankPages = false;
```
## Step 7: Print First Columns on All Pages
Set whether to print a specified number of first columns on all pages.
```csharp
project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageViewSettings.PrintFirstColumnsCountOnAllPages = true;
```
## Step 8: Save the Project with Configured Settings
Finally, save the project with the configured page view settings, specifying the output format, such as PDF.
```csharp
project.Save(DataDir + "ProjectWithComments_out.pdf", SaveFileFormat.Pdf);
```
