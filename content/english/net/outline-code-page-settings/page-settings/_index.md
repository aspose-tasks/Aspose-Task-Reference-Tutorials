## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of configuring Microsoft Project page settings using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Aspose.Tasks is a powerful API that allows developers to manipulate Microsoft Project files programmatically.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Aspose.Tasks for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Tasks for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE for .NET development.

## Importing Namespaces
To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. These namespaces provide access to the Aspose.Tasks classes and methods required for manipulating MS Project files.
```csharp
using Aspose.Tasks;
using System.Linq;
    using System;
    
    using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
    using Aspose.Tasks.Visualization;
```
## Step 1: Load the Project File
First, you need to load the MS Project file that you want to configure the page settings for.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project(dataDir + "Project2.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Access Page Settings
Next, you'll access the page settings of the project file.
```csharp
// Get the settings
var settings = project.DefaultView.PageInfo.PageSettings;
```
## Step 3: Configure Page Settings
Now, let's configure various properties of the page settings according to your requirements.
```csharp
// Set page orientation to portrait
settings.IsPortrait = true;
// Set number of pages in width to be printed
settings.PagesInWidth = 5;
// Set number of pages in height to be printed
settings.PagesInHeight = 7;
// Set percentage of normal size to adjust printing to
settings.PercentOfNormalSize = 200;
// Set paper size
settings.PaperSize = PrinterPaperSize.PaperB4;
// Set first page number for printing
settings.FirstPageNumber = 3;
```
## Step 4: Save the Project File
Finally, save the project file with the updated page settings.
```csharp
SimpleSaveOptions options = new MPPSaveOptions
{
    WriteViewData = true
};
project.Save(dataDir + "TestCanWritePageSettings.mpp", options);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to configure Microsoft Project page settings using Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these steps, you can easily customize page orientation, size, and other printing options according to your requirements.
