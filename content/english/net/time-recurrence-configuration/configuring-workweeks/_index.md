## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on configuring workweeks in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Efficiently managing workweeks is crucial for project planning and scheduling. Aspose.Tasks simplifies this process, allowing you to customize workweeks according to your project's needs. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to configure workweeks seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Tasks Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Tasks library installed in your .NET project. You can download it from the [official Aspose.Tasks website](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
2. .NET Environment: Ensure you are working in a .NET environment, and you have a basic understanding of C# programming.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your project:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## Step 1: Set up your project
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var project = new Project();
```
## Step 2: Create a standard calendar
```csharp
var calendar = project.Calendars.Add("Standard");
Calendar.MakeStandardCalendar(calendar);
```
## Step 3: Define a custom workweek
```csharp
var item = new WorkWeek();
item.Name = "My Work Week";
item.FromDate = new DateTime(2020, 4, 13, 8, 0, 0);
item.ToDate = new DateTime(2020, 4, 17, 17, 0, 0);
```
## Step 4: Specify working days
```csharp
item.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Monday));
item.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Tuesday));
item.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Wednesday));
item.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Thursday));
item.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Friday));
item.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Saturday));
item.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Sunday));
calendar.WorkWeeks.Add(item);
```
## Step 5: Display work week details
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Work Week Number: " + calendar.WeekDays.Count);
foreach (var workWeek in calendar.WorkWeeks)
{
    // Display work week details
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + workWeek.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("Parent calendar name: " + calendar.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("From Date: " + workWeek.FromDate);
    Console.WriteLine("To Date: " + workWeek.ToDate);
    Console.WriteLine();
    // Display special working times for each day
    List<WeekDay> weekDays = workWeek.WeekDays.ToList();
    foreach (var day in weekDays)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(day.DayType.ToString());
        // Display working times
        foreach (var workingTime in day.WorkingTimes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(workingTime.From);
            Console.WriteLine(workingTime.To);
        }
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```
By following these steps, you can easily configure workweeks in Aspose.Tasks, enhancing your project management capabilities.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, managing workweeks is a fundamental aspect of project planning, and Aspose.Tasks simplifies this process with its powerful features. By customizing workweeks according to your project's requirements, you can ensure efficient resource utilization and better project scheduling.
