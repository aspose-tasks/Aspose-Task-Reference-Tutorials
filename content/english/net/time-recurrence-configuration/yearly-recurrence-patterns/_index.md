## Introduction
In the dynamic world of project management, handling recurring tasks efficiently is a key aspect. Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides a powerful solution to configure yearly recurrence patterns, allowing you to streamline your project scheduling and management. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to set up yearly recurrence patterns using Aspose.Tasks.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- A working knowledge of C# and .NET framework.
- Aspose.Tasks library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
- An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.
- Basic understanding of project management concepts.
## Import Namespaces
To start, ensure you import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
    using System;
    
    using Aspose.Tasks.Saving;
```
## Step 1: Set Up the Project
Begin by creating a new Aspose.Tasks project:
```csharp
var project = new Project("Your Document Directory" + "Project1.mpp");
```
## Step 2: Define Recurring Task Parameters
Create a set of parameters for the recurring task:
```csharp
var parameters = new RecurringTaskParameters
{
    TaskName = "t1",
    Duration = project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day),
    RecurrencePattern = new YearlyRecurrencePattern
    {
        Repetition = new ByYearDayRepetition { DayPosition = 1, Month = Month.July },
        RecurrenceRange = new EndByRecurrenceRange
        {
            Start = new DateTime(2018, 7, 1, 8, 0, 0),
            Finish = new DateTime(2019, 7, 1, 17, 0, 0)
        }
    }
};
```
## Step 3: Add Parameters to Project
Include the parameters in the project's task list:
```csharp
project.RootTask.Children.Add(parameters);
```
## Step 4: Save the Project
Save the project with the configured recurrence pattern:
```csharp
project.Save("Your Document Directory" + "WorkWithYearlyRecurrencePattern_out.mpp", SaveFileFormat.Mpp);
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the process of configuring yearly recurrence patterns in Aspose.Tasks for .NET. By following these simple steps, you can enhance your project management capabilities and efficiently handle recurring tasks.
