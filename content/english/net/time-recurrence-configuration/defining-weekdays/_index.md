## Introduction
If you're diving into the world of project management using Aspose.Tasks for .NET, understanding and manipulating weekdays is a crucial aspect. Efficiently managing and customizing weekdays within your project calendar can significantly impact project timelines. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of defining weekdays using Aspose.Tasks, providing step-by-step instructions and examples for better clarity.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Aspose.Tasks for .NET library installed. If not, download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/net/).
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using NUnit.Framework;
```
## 1. Check Weekday Equality
```csharp
// Your document directory
String DataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load project file
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
var calendar = project.Calendars.GetByUid(1);
// Access weekdays
var weekDay1 = calendar.WeekDays[0];
var weekDay2 = calendar.WeekDays[1];
// Check equality based on various properties
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 Day Type: " + weekDay1.DayType);
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
Console.WriteLine("Are weekdays equal: " + weekDay1.Equals(weekDay2));
```
## 2. Clone a Weekday
```csharp
// Load project file
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
var calendar = project.Calendars.GetByUid(1);
var weekDay1 = calendar.WeekDays[0];
// Create a deep copy of the weekday
var weekDay2 = weekDay1.Clone();
// Output properties of both weekdays
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 Day Type: " + weekDay1.DayType);
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
Console.WriteLine("Are weekdays equal: " + weekDay1.Equals(weekDay2));
Console.WriteLine("Are weekdays equal (by reference): " + ReferenceEquals(weekDay1, weekDay2));
```
## 3. Get Hash Code of a Weekday
```csharp
// Load project file
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
var calendar = project.Calendars.GetByUid(1);
var weekDay1 = calendar.WeekDays[1];
var weekDay2 = calendar.WeekDays[2];
// Output properties of both weekdays
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
Console.WriteLine("Week Day 1 Hash Code: {0}", weekDay1.GetHashCode());
Console.WriteLine("Week Day 2 Hash Code: {0}", weekDay2.GetHashCode());
```
## 4. Create a New Calendar with Defined Weekdays
```csharp
// Create a new project
var project = new Project();
// Define a calendar
var calendar = project.Calendars.Add("Calendar1");
// Add working days and exception day
// Add similar output statements for FromDate and ToDate
calendar.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Monday));
calendar.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Tuesday));
calendar.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Wednesday));
calendar.WeekDays.Add(WeekDay.CreateDefaultWorkingDay(DayType.Thursday));
// Set working times for Friday
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
var workingTimes = new List<WorkingTime> { new WorkingTime(9, 12), new WorkingTime(13, 16) };
var dayType = WeekDay.CastToDayType(DayOfWeek.Friday);
var weekDay = new WeekDay(dayType, workingTimes);
weekDay.DayWorking = true;
calendar.WeekDays.Add(weekDay);
```
## 5. Set Default Working Time for a Day
```csharp
// Create a new project
var project = new Project();
var calendar = project.Calendars.Add("Calendar1");
calendar.WeekDays.Clear();
// Add default working times for Monday through Friday
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
var monday = new WeekDay(DayType.Monday);
WeekDay.SetDefaultWorkingTime(monday);
calendar.WeekDays.Add(monday);
// Repeat for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
// Set non-working days for Saturday and Sunday
// Add similar output statements for DayWorking, FromDate, ToDate, and WorkingTimes
var saturday = new WeekDay(DayType.Saturday);
saturday.DayWorking = false;
calendar.WeekDays.Add(saturday);
var sunday = new WeekDay(DayType.Sunday);
sunday.DayWorking = false;
calendar.WeekDays.Add(sunday);
```
