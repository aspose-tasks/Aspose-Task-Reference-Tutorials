## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** *Can I create multiple baselines for the same task?*  
**A:** Yes. Aspose.Tasks allows you to add up to ten baselines (Baseline 1‑Baseline 10) for each task.

**Q:** *What happens if I set a baseline date that is earlier than the project start date?*  
**A:** The API will automatically adjust the baseline to match the project’s calendar constraints, but you should verify the dates to avoid schedule inconsistencies.

**Q:** *Is it possible to read an existing baseline from a .mpp file?*  
**A:** Absolutely. You can load a Project file and access the `BaselineStart`, `BaselineFinish`, and `BaselineDuration` properties of each task.

**Q:** *Do I need to re‑save the project after adding a baseline?*  
**A:** Yes. After modifying baseline information, call `project.save("output.mpp")` to persist the changes.

**Q:** *Can I use this approach with other file formats such as .xml or .pdf?*  
**A:** The baseline APIs work with all formats supported by Aspose.Tasks (MPP, XML, Primavera, etc.). Exporting to PDF will reflect the baseline data in any generated reports.
